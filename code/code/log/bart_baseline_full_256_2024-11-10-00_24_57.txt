Lyrics: On Two bicycles; On a hillside desolate; Could nature make a man of me yet?; ; Under this charming car; This charming man; ; Why ponder life's complexities; When the leather runs smooth; On the passenger seat?; ; I would go out tonight; But I haven't got a stitch to wear; This man said "it's crucial; That someone so handsome should care"; ; Ah! I'm just a country boy; Who never knew his place; He said "return the ring"; He knows so much about these things; He knows so much about these things; ; I would go out tonight; But I haven't got a stitch to wear; This man said "it's crucial; That someone so handsome should care"; La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...; La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...; ; Ah! I'm just a country boy; Who never knew his place; He said "return the ring"; He knows so much about these things; He knows so much about these things; He knows so much about these things
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a country boy who never knew his placeHe said "return the ring"He knows so much about these thingsAnd he knows all about the thingsHe knows that someone so handsome should careI would go out tonightBut I haven't got a stitch to wearThis man said "it's crucialThat someone so gorgeous should careLa, la, la-la, this charming man"I think it's about a boy who doesn't know his place, and he knows that he doesn't want to be in love with someone who's so handsome that he can't care about him. I think that this is a reference to a guy who was married and had a baby, but he didn't know anything about the world. He doesn't think that he's going to care about someone else, so he's just going to be there for him. It's a simple song, but it's a very powerful one. I love it!
Ground Truth: Why does every band in existence feel the need to do a shitty Smiths cover?!!? I wish they'd stop. This goes for that Colin Meloy, as well. You do fine pretending to be frolicking troubadour with a blend of pretension and weirdness, so why also pretend to be Morrissey? Meloy and Gibbard look strikingly similar, and for some reason I'm convinved that they are the same person:Exhibit A: They both hail from the Pacific Northwest. Exhibit B: They both have huge round heads that have extreme similarities. With a little bit of modern plastic technology and some adhesive, one could easily 'transform' into the other. mrrochesteron January 05, 2006   
Lyrics: Joan was quizzical; Studied pataphysical; Science in the home; Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh; Maxwell Edison; ; Majoring in medicine; Calls her on the phone; "Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?"; But as she's getting ready to go; ; A knock comes on the door; Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head; Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead; Back in school again; ; Maxwell plays the fool again; Teacher gets annoyed; Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene; She tells Max to stay; When the class has gone away; So he waits behind; Writing fifty times "I must not be so", oh, oh, oh; But when she turns her back on the boy; He creeps up from behind; ; Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head; Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead; P.C. 31; Said "We've caught a dirty one"; ; Maxwell stands alone; ; Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh; Rose and Valerie; Screaming from the gallery; Say "He must go free" ("Maxwell must go free"); The judge does not agree; And he tells them so, oh, oh, oh; But as the words are leaving his lips; A noise comes from behind; Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head; Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead; Silver hammer win
Sample outputs: This song is about a girl who is going through a tough time in her life. She's trying to get out of it, but she doesn't know what to do. She doesn't want to go back to school. She wants to be with the boy, but he's too scared to leave her. So she says "I must not be so", and he goes back to being with her. The judge does not agree and he tells them so, but as the words are leaving his lipsA noise comes from behindBang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was deadBack in school again. Maxwell plays the fool again. Teacher gets annoyedWishing to avoid an unpleasant sceneShe tells Max to stay when the class has gone awaySo he waits behind writing fifty times "I can not be too", and she turns her back on the boy. He creeps up from behind. Bang, bang. Maxwell’s silver hammer came down upon her head. Clang, clang, Maxwell” made sure he was dead. P.C. 31, Said “We’ve caught a dirty one.” Maxwell stands alone. Painting testimonial pictures, oh oh oh, oh, and Rose and Valerie Screaming from the gallerySay “He must go free” and say “I must be so”. It seems to me like the judge is trying to convince Maxwell that he can’t go free, that he has to go to jail. He’ll never be free, because he is too afraid to go home to his parents, and he will be locked up forever.
Ground Truth: who cares what its about. this is the best song ever. and i mean ever. "Bang bang Maxwell’s silver hammer came down upon her head, Bang bang Maxwell’s silver hammer made sure that she was dead." Thrdfooton December 29, 2004   
Lyrics: We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much; But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us; It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress; 'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust; Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over; 'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt; 'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya; And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya; Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone; It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go; Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so; Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's; Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?; I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this; It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be; Like tryin' to start over; I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster; Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over; It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya; You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a; ; I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon; And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you; ; 250, 000 miles on a clear night in June; ; And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you; ; I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes; My body aches when I ain't with you I have zero strength; There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths; Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks; Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?; You want 'em when they don't want you; Soon as they do, feelings change; It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate; I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate; But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?; ; Let's cut to the chase; 'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break; ; And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake; ; 'Cause I'm a; ; I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon; ; And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you; 250, 000 miles on a clear night in June; And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you; ; So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want; But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once; I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God; I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms; Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'; You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'; I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'; Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick; Ain't a possible reason I can think of; To let you walk up out this house and let you live; Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give; And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this; ; And I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you; But it's over now, it's too late to save our love; Just promise me you'll think of me; Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a; ; I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon; And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you; 250, 000 miles on a clear night in June; And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you
Sample outputs: I love this song. I think it's about a guy who is in love with a girl, but he doesn't want to be with her, so he's trying to stop her from falling for him. He's saying that he's going to do whatever it takes when I'm with you, right at you. But he's also saying that it's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told yaYou take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a. I'm going down this road all alone. It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go. Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's. Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this? I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this. It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be. Like tryin to start over. I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster. Somethin' I won't go on so you toy with my emotions, ho it's over. It’s like an exploding every time i hold yaI wasn’t jokin’ when i told ya. You take my Breath Away, you’re a Supernova, and I’m a. You want me when they don't want you. Soon as they do, feelings changeIt's not a contest and I ain’�t on no conquest for no mate. I am going to stop you from breathin’ until you die. And so much is at stake. What the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chaseFore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break. And leave myself open that I won`t be makin’ a mistake. And I'm gonna do what it takes, when I am with you I get the shakesMy body aches when I ain`t with youI have zero strength. There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths. Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinksGonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it’ll never be the same? You want 'em when they dont want youSoon as they don’
Ground Truth: This is another song about murder from Eminem. They all have the same theme of murder or suicide but they're all different in their own ways. (e.g. Stan, Love the Way You Lie, Space Bound) It's about a hoe trying to leave Eminem, but he's in love so he snaps and threathens to kill her. Then, he realises he loves her and can't, so shoots himself instead. Woodsy13on September 12, 2011   
Lyrics: Swollen with liquid; Ready to burst; A load of my lymph; Will quench this dead bosy's thirst; One month in the grave; Twisted and half decayed; She turned a putrid yellow; I pissed in her maggot filled asshole; Fucking the rotting; My semen is bleeding; The smell of decay; Seeps from her genital cavity; The smell was unbearable; As i unburied her; I cum blood; From my erection; I feel it run; Down her throat; Swallow; Eyes glassy and vacant; Body dug up to play with; Skin greasy and naked; Tonguing her rotten anus; I need a live woman; To fill with my fluid; A delicate girl; To mutilate, fuck and kill; Her body exceptional; She thought I was normal; But I wanted more; I came blood inside of her; Choking on the clot; Gagging on the snot; Gushing blood from her mouth; Bloody gel leaking out!; Body buried in a shallow grave; Unmarked for none to find; The sickness i have left behind; Undetected go my crimes; The greatest thrill of my life; To slit my own cock with a knife; Violent; Climax; Serging serum; On; My; Skin; Back from the dead; I am resurrected to spew; PUTREFACTION!!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about the death of a girl who was raped by her boyfriend. It's about how it's like he's still alive, but he's buried in a shallow grave, because he can't find the body. I think it's about the end of the relationship, and how he wants to kill her. "Swollen with liquid Ready to burstA load of my lymphWill quench this dead bosy's thirstOne month in the graveTwisted and half decayedShe turned a putrid yellowI pissed in her maggot filled assholeFucking the rottingMy semen is bleedingThe smell of decaySeeps from her genital cavityThe smell was unbearableAs i unburied herI cum blood from my erectionI feel it runDown her throatSwallow Eyes glassy and vacantBody dug up to play withSkin greasy and naked Tonguing her rotten anusI need a live womanTo fill with my fluidA delicate girlTo mutilate, fuck and killHer body exceptionalShe thought I was normalBut I wanted moreI came blood inside of herChoking on the clotGagging on the snotGushing blood from her mouth Bloody gel leaking outThe sickness i have left behindUndetected go my crimesThe greatest thrill of my lifeTo slit my own cock with a knife ViolentClimax Serging serumOn My SkinBack from the deadI am resurrected to spewPUTREFACTION!! I think this is about a guy who's been raped by his ex-wife, and he's trying to get her to kill him, but she's killing him and he doesn't want to stop him from killing her. He thinks he's normal but he wants more. He wants to get rid of her, so he can kill her, but it's hard. He can't do that because he knows he's going to be crucified, and that he'll have to do it again. I don't really think he's talking about killing his ex wife, but I think he is talking about how he feels about her, and what he feels when he's crucified. "Sitting in her graveUnmarked for none to findThe sickness I have left left behindUnetected went my crimes"I think that this is a reference to the fact that he's been crucified by her.
Ground Truth: OK, I JUST LISTENED TO THE SONG. I BET IM THE ONLY ONE ON THIS WHOLE PAGE NOW WHO !!!!!!!!!!! HAS HEARD THE SONG PLAYED !!!!!! so let me first say this much. the song itself sucks, i mean music wise. second of all, anyone who said this song offended them NEVER HEARD THE SONG. THEY ONLY READ THE LYRICS. WHEN I LISTENED TO THE SONG, HONESTLY, I COULD NOT MAKE OUT 1 WORD THE SINGER SAID. not one word!!!!!! how can that offend anyone? answer that. all you people who put down the song should be ashamed. you were way off. if your parents heard the song the lyrics could of been about, well anti abortion. lol. either way it get the same reaction with a bunch of strangers.

Lyrics: K, it's your ride; Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle; Pretend; Your garden grow, and it's your day to wed; ; We found your man; He's drinking up, he's all-American; And he'll drive; He's volunteered with grace to end your life; ; We'll tidy up; It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us; You explode; You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars; ; Feather oars; The world tilts back and pours and pours and so; You satellite; You tidal wave, you're a big surprise; ; And I've one more night; To be your mother; ; The signal interrupts; Baby's frequency not strong enough, remain; In my hands, and smile, we will miss you; But in time you'll get settled, and we will write; ; Hey, beauty supreme; Yeah, you were right about me; But can I get myself out from underneath; This guilt that will crush me?; ; And in the choir; I saw our sad messiah; He was bored and tired of my laments; Said, "I died for you one time, but never again"; ; Never again, never again, never again, never again; Never again, never again, never again, never again; ; Well, I love you so much (Never again); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again); No, 'cause I can dish it out (Never again); But I can't take it (Never again); ; Well, I love you so much (Never again); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again); 'Cause I can dish it out (Never again); But I can't take it (Never again); ; One will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Two will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Three will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Four will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Five will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Six will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Seven loves you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; (I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth); Seven loves you so much; (We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; (I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd); 'Cause I can dish it out; (I should be laughing right now); But I can't take it; ; (I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth); Seven loves you so much; (We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; (I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd); 'Cause I can dish it out; (I should be laughing right now); But I can't take it; ; (I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth); Seven loves you so much; (We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; (I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd); 'Cause I can dish it out; (I should be laughing right now...); But I can't take it
Sample outputs: I love this song. It's one of my favorite songs on the album. It has so much meaning, and it's so beautiful. It reminds me of a guy who died for a girl who he loved so much, but he couldn't take it anymore because he had to deal with the guilt that will crush him. It also reminds me a lot of my ex-boyfriend who died in a car crash. I think it's about how he was in love with this girl, but now he can't take the pain anymore. He loves her so much but he can never take it back because he knows that she will always be there for him, and that he will never have to lose his baby in the crowd. He'll always love her, but she will never be with him again, because he will always remember her. He will always love this girl and will never forget her. I love it when he says "But do me a favor baby, don't reply, cause I can dish it out, but I cant take it" and he is saying that he loves her because he loves this girl so much. He says "I'll never have the opportunity to buy adjacent plots of earth" but he won't be able to take it again because he doesn't have the money to buy them. He also says "And in the choir, I saw our sad messiah, he was bored and tired of my laments, Said, "I died for you one time, but never again, never again." He's saying that she loves him so much and that she can't get herself out of the crowd, because she'll never get out of it. He is telling her that she'll always be with this guy and that they'll never be together again, but they'll always have the same feelings. He doesn't want to have to do anything to be with her again, so he says, "But I'll never ever have to get myself out from underneath, this guilt will crush me." I think this song is about the fact that you can never get yourself out of your head, because you'll never know what you'll do, but you'll always know that you love him.

Lyrics: I will stop, I will stop at nothing; Say the right things when electioneering; Trust I can rely on your vote; When I go forwards you go backwards; And somewhere we will meet; When I go forwards you go backwards; And somewhere we will meet; Ha ha ha; Riot shields, voodoo economics; It's just business, cattle prods and the IMF; Trust I can rely on your vote; When I go forwards you go backwards; And somewhere we will meet; When I go forwards you go backwards; And somewhere we will meet
Sample outputs: I think it's about a person who can't rely on his or her vote to make decisions. It's about how he can rely on the people he loves, but he can't trust them to make his decisions. "Riot shields, voodoo economics, it's just business, cattle prods and the IMF" refers to the fact that he can only rely on their vote, and that he has to depend on them for his decision-making. "I will stop, I will stop at nothing,Say the right things when electioneering" is a reference to how he will always rely on them, and how they will always be there for him. "When I go forwards, you go backwards" is referring to the idea that he will go forward, and he will eventually meet the people who love him, and they will be able to rely on each other. "Where I will meet, when I go backwards, and somewhere we will meet."
Ground Truth: Fairly straightforward song (for once) but its the best, not just because of the lyrics but the sound "I trust I can rely on your vote" really makes you think about the crap politicians come out with in order to secure your vote... Especially relevant now...blaqk_fairyon October 07, 2007   
Lyrics: Fame is but a fruit tree; So very unsound; It can never flourish; Till its stalk is in the ground; So men of fame; Can never find a way; Till time has flown; Far from their dying day; ; Forgotten while you're here; Remembered for a while; A much updated ruin; From a much updated style; ; Life is but a memory; Happened long ago; Theatre full of sadness; For a long forgotten show; ; Seems so easy; Just to let it go on by; Till you stop and wonder; Why you never wondered why; Safe in a womb of an everlasting night; You find the darkness can give the brightest light; ; Safe in your place deep in the earth; That's when they'll know; What you are really worth; ; Forgotten while you're here; Remembered for a while; A much updated ruin; From a much updated style; ; Fame is but a fruit tree; So very unsound; It can never flourish; Till its stalk is in the ground; So men of fame can never find a way; Till time has flown far from their dying day; ; Fruit tree; Fruit tree; No one knows you but the rain and the air; Don't you worry; They'll stand and stare when you're gone; Fruit tree; Fruit tree; Open your eyes to another year; They will know that you were here; when you are gone
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a fruit tree. He can never find a way out of it, so he tries to find a new way out, but he can't. "Fame is but a Fruit TreeSo very unsoundIt can never flourishTill its stalk is in the groundSo men of fameCan never find the wayTill time has flownFar from their dying day"The fruit tree is a symbol of fame. The fruit tree symbolizes fame. It symbolises fame, fame, and fortune. It is also symbolic of the people who are going through the same thing.
Ground Truth: I've always read the line as "'til its stock is in the ground" - i.e when the fruit that has not sold is plowed back into the earth (to function as fertilizer, effectively). This would be in keeping with the metaphor. And the way Nick Drake pronounces 'stock' is in keeping with his educated accent: to hear 'stalk' would give him an American lilt. Anyone agree? johnny6666on February 21, 2011   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: I could sleep, I could sleep; I could sleep, I could sleep; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; ; I could sleep, I could sleep; I could sleep, I could sleep; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; ; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; My house; ; I could sleep, I could sleep; I could sleep, I could sleep; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; ; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; My house; ; I could sleep, I could sleep; I could sleep, I could sleep; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; ; When I lived alone; Is there a ghost in my house?; My house
Sample outputs: I love this song. I think it's about a guy who is trying to get out of a relationship with a girl, but she doesn't want to. He's trying to help her, but the girl doesn't really want to help him, and he can't sleep. He wants to sleep, but it's not going to work out, so he doesn't.
Ground Truth: I always thought this song was brilliant; two lines (could) say so much. To me the meaning that jumped out was that he doesn't live alone any more; someone has moved in with him. Probably a significant other; and since they moved in together he feels like he doesn't even know that person any more. They're completely gone, different, just a ghost of their former self, and it keeps him up at night. Stereoscopeon September 19, 2010   
Lyrics: When I think about my life; I wonder if I will survive; To live to see in 25 or will I just fall?; Like all my friends, they just keep dying.; People round me, always crying.; In this place I like to call my home.; ; Not everyone knows, that everybody goes to a better place.; Not everybody knows that everybody could be living their last days; But the hard times will come, and we'll keep movin' on.; We're movin' on.; Keep movin' on.; ; Life. Hope. Truth. Trust.; Faith. Pride. Love. Lust.; ; All make up the things we've lost; but things we've gained we'll take with us.; ; And all i have is these two hands; To make myself a better man; I wonder if I'll ever see the end of this.; And all this rain it keeps on falling; On my head and now I'm calling; Out to someone else to help me; Make it through.; ; Not everyone knows, but everybody goes to a better place.; Not everyone knows that everybody could be living their last days; But the hard times will come, and we'll keep movin' on.; We're moving on.; Keep moving on.; ; Life. Hope. Truth. Trust.; Faith. Pride. Love. Lust.; Pain. Hate. Lies. Guilt.; Laugh. Cry. Live. Die.; ; Some friends become enemies; Some friends become your family.; Make the best with what you're given; This ain't dyin', this is livin'!; ; Said we're movin' on; And we got nothing to prove; To anyone; Cause we'll get through; We're movin' on and on and on and on...; Life. Hope. Truth. Trust.; Faith.Pride. Love. Lust.; Pain. Hate. Lies. Guilt.; Laugh. Cry. Live. Die.; Some friends become enemies; some friends become your family.; Make the best with what you're given; This ain't dyin', this is livin'!
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl who is going through a tough time in her life, and she doesn't know if she'll ever see the end of the relationship. she wants to live her life to the fullest, but she can't because she's afraid of losing the guy she loves, and doesn't want to lose the guy. she's trying to make herself a better man, but he's not willing to do that. shes trying to convince herself that she'll be able to make it through the tough times, but it's not going to work out. she is trying to get through the hard times, because she knows it's going to be hard for her, and that's why she's going through it. and she's telling herself she'll get through it, and then she's saying she's gonna make the best of what she has. and then the last verse is saying that she's just going to let it all go, and eventually she'll move on. and the last part of the chorus is saying, "we've got nothing to prove to anyone, cause we'll get thru" and "we're moving on, keep moving on" and that she is going to keep going, no matter what happens. and i think that's what this song means to me. it's about trying to figure out what it means to you, and realizing that you're not the only one. and how you can't help but feel sorry for yourself, and you have to move on and move on, because you're going to have to live your life. and it really is hard, but you know you can do it, so you're gonna get through. and in the end, you'll just have to do whatever it takes to make yourself feel better. and if you do, then you'll know that you'll never be the same again. but that's just what i think. and thats what i'm trying to say. i love this song, i think it's the best song i've ever heard. and its a great song, and one of the best songs on the album. it is one of my all time favorite songs. it makes me feel like i can do anything, because it's all worth it. i really love the song.
Ground Truth: I really like this song i haven't heard it yet but i love the lyrics to the song....there really truthfull kinda i guess u could say..if u read them you can see what im sorta trying to say! i just love good charlotte in general and i love all there songs!

Lyrics: Strange face, with your eyes; so pale and sincere.; underneath you know well; you have nothing to fear.; for the dreams that came to you when so young; told of a life; where spring is sprung.; You would seem so frail; in the cold of the night; when the armies of emotion; go out to fight.; but while the earth sinks to its grave; you sail to the sky; on the crest of a wave.; So forget this cruel world; where i belong; i'll just sit and wait; and sing my song.; and if one day you should see me in the crowd; lend a hand and lift me; to your place in the cloud.
Sample outputs: "Strange face, with your eyes so pale and sincere underneath you know well, you have nothing to fear for the dreams that came to you when so young, told of a life where spring is sprung, you would seem so frail in the cold of the night, when the armies of emotion go out to fight, but while the earth sinks to its grave, you sail to the sky, on the crest of a wave, so forget this cruel world where i belong, i'll just sit and wait, and sing my song, and if one day you should see me in the crowd, lend a hand and lift me to your place in the cloud. "I don't know what to make of this song, but I don't think it's about a guy who falls in love with a girl, or a girl who wants to be with him, but doesn't want to. "You would seem, so frail,In the cold, the nightWhen the armies are emotion, go out, fight"I think it could be about the girl who is in love, but isn't. "So forget the cruel world, where I belong. I'll just do my song." I think that's what it means to me, and I think it means that he's trying to convince her that he doesn't need her, and that he'll just wait for her to see him, and he won't give up on her, because he's just waiting for her. "But while the Earth sinks to it grave, and you sail the sky on a wave. So forget, cruel world. where i belongs." I'm pretty sure that's just what the song means, but it's also a way of saying that he wants her to know that he loves her, but she's not going to let it happen, because she's too busy being with him. "No matter how hard she tries, she'll always be there for him, even if she doesn't know how to love him, or if she'll ever love him again, and she'll never love him back, and will always love him. I think this song is about a girl that has a lot of problems, but can't get over it, and wants to get over them, so she's waiting for him to see her again.
Ground Truth: This song has a ethereal, weightless feel to it. It has a drifiting cloudlike or wavelike quality to it, like you're being swept away. I love the cello solo that weaves in and out of the guitar and drum and the naked sincerity and humility of his lyrics. suclid003on April 28, 2006

Lyrics: Never been near a university,; Never took a paper or a learned degree,; And some of your friends think that's stupid of me,; But it's nothing that I care about.; ; Well I don't know how to tell the weight of the sun,; And of mathematics well I want none,; And I may be the mayor of simpleton,; But I know one thing,; And that's I love you.; When their logic grows cold and all thinking gets done,; You'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of simpleton.; ; I can't have been there when brains were handed round; (please be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton),; Or get past the cover of your books profound,; (please be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton),; And some of your friends thinks it's really unsound,; That you're even seen talking to me.; ; Well I don't know how to write a big hit song,; And all crossword puzzles well I just shun,; And I may be the mayor of simpleton,; But I know one thing,; And that's I love you.; ; I'm not proud of the fact that I never learned much,; Just feel I should say,; What you get is all real,; I can't put on an act,; It takes brains to do that anyway. (and anyway...); ; And I can't unravel riddles, problems and puns,; How the home computer has me on the run,; And I may be the mayor of simpleton,; But I know one thing,; And that's I love you (I love you).; ; If depth of feeling is a currency,; (please be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton),; Then I'm the man who grew the money tree,; (no chain of office and no hope of getting one).; Some of your friends are too brainy to see,; That they're paupers and that's how they'll stay.; ; Well I don't know how many pounds make up a tonne,; Of all the nobel prizes that I've never won,; And I may be the mayor of simpleton,; But I know one thing,; And that's I love you.; ; When all logic grows cold and all thinking gets done,; You'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of simpleton.; You'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of simpleton.; You'll be warm in the arms of the mayor.; (please be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton.)
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been in a relationship for a long time and he is trying to convince himself that he can be the mayor of simpleton, but he can't because he doesn't know what to do with his life. He's saying that he's not proud of the fact that he never learned much, just feel I should say, what you get is all real, I can't put on an act, it takes brains to do that anyway (and anyway) and he knows that he has to do what he wants to do to make the relationship work, and that he loves her even more. He knows that even though he knows he's in love with her, he knows it's not going to work out, and he's trying to make it work. He wants to be the Mayor of Simpleton but he cant because he's too brainy to see, that's how they'll stay.
Ground Truth: This comes across as a reply to the question "Don't you know she's too good for you?" It's really an interesting take on a love song, since he's pretty much saying in a very roundabout way that he doesn't need to know much else besides his love for her. The fact that Partridge does this with a sarcastic and witty way I believe is his way of saying that even if he's just a ditchdigger, that doesn't mean that he can't love.
Lyrics: A place where nobody dared to go; The love that we came to know; They call it Xanadu (It takes your breath and leave you blind); And now, open your eyes and see; What we have made is real; We are in Xanadu (A dream of it we offer you); ; A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star; An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally; ; Xanadu; Xanadu; (Now we are here) In Xanadu; ; Xanadu; Xanadu; (Now we are here) In Xanadu; Xanadu, your neon lights will shine; For you, Xanadu; ; The love, the echoes of long ago; You needed the world to know; They are in Xanadu (With every breath you drift away); The dream that came through a million years; That lived on through all the tears; It came to Xanadu; (The dream you dream, well it will happen for you); ; A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star; An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally; ; Xanadu; Xanadu; (Now we are here) In Xanadu; ; Xanadu; Xanadu; (Now we are here) In Xanadu; ; Now that I'm here, now that you're near; In Xanadu; Now that I'm here, now that you're near; In Xanadu; Xanadu
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has fallen in love with a girl and he's waiting for her to come back to him, but she's not coming back. It's about a girl that he's been in a relationship with for a million years and she's still waiting for him back. He's telling her that he loves her so much that he wants to be with her, but he knows that he can't go back to her. He wants her to know that he cares about her, and that he'll always be there for her. "A million lights are dancing and there you are, a shooting star, an everlasting world, and you're here with me eternally." He's saying that she's here with him, and he'll be there with her forever. I think he's saying he's here for her, because he's always been there. "The love, the echoes of long ago, you needed the world to know"He's saying to her that she needs to move on, because she's in a place where nobody dared to go. "And now we are here, in Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you, Xanada." He is saying that he has always loved her and that she is there for him, so he's not going to let her go. He says "The dream that came through million years, that lived on through all the tears" and "It came to Xanada, now that I'm here now that you're near." He doesn't want her to go back, he just wants to see her again, and she knows that she'll be with him forever. "Now that I’m hereNow that you’re near"He says that he’s waiting for the girl to return to him. He has been waiting so long for her for so long that he knows she’ll never see him again. "They are in Xanada (With every breath you drift away)The dream of it we offer you"He is telling her he's going to be there forever, and it will happen for him.
Ground Truth: My Favorite Movie EVER! Oh my this movie is one of my best memories. My dad (whom I tease is "slightly gay") loves this movie and we watched it all the time. So much so that even my morbid brother knows the songs and can quote the movies. We love every song from the movie and always sing them. It never fails that when I see him, this movie is put in the ole DVD and enjoyed by all (yes, even my bro).
Lyrics: This last one-way ticket train pulls in; We smile for the casual closure capturing; There goes the downpour; Here goes my fare thee well; ; There's really no way to reach me; There's really no way to reach me; There's really no way to reach me; 'Cause I'm already gone; ; There's only so many words that we could say; Spoken upon long-distance melody.; This is my hello; This is my goodness; ; There's really no way to reach me; There's really no way to reach me; There's really no way to reach me; 'Cause I'm already gone; ; Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet again; Straighten this whole thing out.; Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy; This is the distance; This is my gameface; ; There's really no way to reach me; There's really no way to reach me; Is there really no way to reach me; Am I already; So this is your Maverick; This is Vienna
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has moved away from his girl. He has no way to reach her, but he's going to leave her. He's already gone, and he's waiting for her to come back to him. He doesn't know if he'll ever be able to get her back, or if she'll even see him again. He knows he'll never find her again, but it's hard to let go of him, because he's not going to be there for her anymore. The line "There's only so many words that we could saySpoken upon long-distance melodyThis is my hello, this is my goodness" is about how he feels when he's gone, even though he's so close to her. "Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet againStraighten this whole thing outMaybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemyThis is the distance, This is my gameface" means that he's leaving her, and that he has to go back to her, even if it's just to be with her. It's a beautiful song, but I think it's about a man who's gone so long that he doesn't want to face the fact that she's not there for him anymore. I think the line "This is your MaverickThis is Vienna" could be a reference to how he's trying to tell her that he'll always be there, but she doesn't care, because she's too close to him, and she's telling him that she'll never be the same without him. The last line "Am I already so this is your maverick" could also be about how she feels when she's gone. She's saying that he is already gone and he can't reach her because she hasn't seen him in a long time. And she's saying "I'm already so I'm already" so he's telling her that she needs to go on with her life, but that she has to leave him, or he won't ever see her again. And he's saying he's already done it, and it's time to move on.
Ground Truth: I really see this song as being the after occurence of the song Hundred. In Hundred, Isaac is talking about having problems in the relationship, they're trying to work things out but because their just unsure on where they stand, what to say or do things are very difficult between them. Now in Vienna it seems like he's realised that the relationship needs to end. They have communication problems & one or both people can't be truly honest about their feelings thus "maybe in 5 or 10 (years) yours & mine will meet again & straighten this whole thing out". "The day's last one-way ticket train pulls in" I think this could literally mean he's getting on the last train out for that day, or it's figurative for it being the final time he'll be leaving their relationship. The words "last" & "oneway" bear lots of importance here. He's saying it's the last time he leaves (they may have had breakups before but ended up back together) & there's no way of returning (one way ticket). "There goes the downpourHere goes my fare thee well"Usually when it's starts raining - pouring in this case - it's an indication that it's time to go, therefore he has to bid her farewell to catch the train OR it could mean things have become very emotional & one or both have started crying, so he needs to say goodbye & leave before he thinks he can't do it. "There's really no way to reach me, cos i'm already gone"I feel like he's saying, it doesn't matter what she tries to tell him, or if she convinces him not to leave it won't matter, she won't get it through to him because he's "already gone", already made up his mind & has for a while now. "Only so many words that we can saySpoken upon long-distance melody"There are so many things to be/could be said though they won't get a chance to say them.. they'll keep it inside through the time apart or think about it seperately in the 2 places they're at. "This is my helloThis is my goodness"His goodbye is also his hello, & his goodness is in not completely closing the door on their relationship. [Maybe i
Lyrics: We don't need no education; We don't need no thought control; No dark sarcasm in the classroom; Teachers leave them kids alone; ; Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone!; All in all it's just another brick in the wall; All in all you're just another brick in the wall; ; We don't need no education; We don't need no thought control; No dark sarcasm in the classroom; Teachers leave them kids alone; ; Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone!; All in all you're just another brick in the wall; All in all you're just another brick in the wall; ; (Wrong, do it again; If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding; How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?; You, yes you behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddie!)
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how kids don't want to be in a school because they're afraid of the teachers. I think the line "You yes you behind the bike sheds, stand still laddie" is referring to how the teachers feel about their children and how they're just another brick in the wall. I don't think that this song has anything to do with the teachers, I think it's about how the kids in the school don't know what to do and they don't feel like they're doing anything to help them. I also think that the song is saying that the teachers don't really care about the kids because they are too scared to do anything about it. It's also saying that if you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding. And how can you have some pudding if you dont eat your food? I think that's what the song means to me. It could be about how teachers are always there for you, but they're always there to help you when you need them. Maybe it's saying that when you're in school, you feel like you're alone, and they're there to comfort you.
Ground Truth: Ok i have heard that this song is about my school (Hills Road 6th Form) Which happens to be where 2 of the band were educated before it became a 6th form when it was just a boys school. if you think about it it fits in well with how bad school can feel "no dark sarcasm in the classroom" Having to conform to the teachers boring rules lead to sarcasm outside the classroom between boys and sometimes snuck into the classroom. i sure as hell know im full of sarcasm in the classroom and outside of it these days! robwilkinon May 06, 2007   
Lyrics: Everybody's here with me; Got no camera to see; Don't think I'm all in this world; The camera won't let me go; The verdict doesn't love our soul; The digital won't let me go; ; Yeah yeah yeah, I'll pay; (Yeah, yeah); When tomorrow, tomorrow comes today; ; Stereo, I want it on; It's taken me far too long; Don't think I'm all in this world; I don't think I'll be here too long; I don't think I'll be here too long; I don't think I'll be here too long; ; Yeah yeah yeah, I'll pay; When tomorrow, tomorrow comes today; (Yeah, yeah)
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who doesn't want to be in this world. He wants to be with a girl, but he doesn't think he'll be around too long. He doesn't know what to do with himself, and he wants to go back to his old life. And he knows he'll never be with her again, and it's taken him far too long to do that. He's trying to convince himself that he'll always be there for her, even though he knows it's not going to work out. He just wants to get back to the old world, where he's happy and happy. But he's afraid that he won't be able to do anything about it, so he's going to have to pay for it. So he's saying "I don't think I'll be here too long, I don't know if I'll ever be here to long." He's saying that he's never going to be there to see her again and he's just waiting for her to come back to him. He loves her and he loves her so much, he wants her back, but she's not ready to let him go.
Ground Truth: I think you guys look into this way too much. It isn't a message in music form; it's music. It's emotion. The song has such a desperate, rat in a cage, feeling. He's lost in a world he doesn't understand and it never stops and it never starts. It's the constant loneliness of the world. Thevolatilon July 20, 2009

Lyrics: It ain't no joke; I'd like to buy the world a toke; And teach the world; to sing in perfect harmony; And teach the world; to snuff the fires and the liars; Hey, I know it's just a song,; but it's spice for the recipe; ; This is a love attack; I know it went out, but it's back; It's just like any fad,; it retracts before impact; And just like fashion,; it's a passion for the with-it and hip; If you got the goods,; they'll come and buy it; just to stay in the clique; ; So don't delay, act now,; supplies are running out; Allow if you're still alive; Six to eight years to arrive; And if you follow,; there may be a tomorrow; But if the offer's shunned; You might as well be walking on the Sun; ; Twenty-five years ago,; they spoke out and they broke out; Of recession and oppression; and together they toked; And they folked out with; guitars around a bonfire; Just singin' and clappin', man,; what the hell happened?; ; Then some were spellbound,; some were hellbound; Some, they fell down; and some got back up; And fought back against the meltdown; And their kids were hippie chicks,; all hypocrites; Because fashion is smashing; the true meaning of it; ; So don't delay, act now,; supplies are running out; Allow if you're still alive; Six to eight years to arrive; And if you follow,; there may be a tomorrow; But if the offer's shunned; You might as well be walking on the Sun...; ; It ain't no joke; When a mama's handkerchief is soaked; With her tears because her baby's; life has been revoked; The bond is broke up; So choke up and focus; on the close up; Mr. Wizard can't perform; no god-like hocus-pocus; ; So don't sit back, kick back; And watch the world get bushwhacked; News at 10, your neighborhood is under attack; Put away the crack,; before the crack puts you away; You need to be there; when your baby's old enough to relate; ; So don't delay, act now,; supplies are running out; Allow if you're still alive; Six to eight years to arrive; And if you follow,; there may be a tomorrow; But if the offer's shunned; You might as well be walking on the Sun; You might as well be walking on the Sun; You might as well be walking on the Sun; You might as well be walking on the Sun; You might as well be walking on the Sun...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how the media is trying to tell us that we should be happy with our lives, and that we shouldn't be afraid of the media. It's a good song, but it's not the best song, and its not the worst song on the album. I don't think it's about the media, but just the fact that the media wants us to be happy, and if we don't, then we can't be happy. I think this is just a song about how we should live our life and not worry about what others think, and how we need to live our lives in order to live in peace and harmony. I'm not saying that the song is anti-war, but I think it is about people who don't want to live their life, because they don't believe in what they want to do, and they're afraid of what the media will do to them. The song is also about how people don't know if they're going to live life to the fullest, so they need to learn to live with the media and the media because they're all hypocrites. The line, "If you follow, there may be a tomorrow, but if the offer's shunned, you might as well be walking on the Sun," is just saying that they're not going to change their ways, they're just going to keep living their life as they are, because that's what they're doing, and it's the only way they can live it. The last line is saying that if you don't follow the media's propaganda, they won't be able to change what they've done, and you can't change what you've done. So don't delay, act now. supplies are running out. Allow if you're still alive. Six to eight years to arrive. And if you follow there may have a tomorrow. But if the offers aren't shunned. You might have a better life. It ain't no joke. When a mama's handkerchief is soaked with her tears because her baby's life has been revoked. The bond is broke up. So choke up and focus on the close up. Mr. Wizard can't perform. No god-like hocus-pocus. So watch the world get bushwhacked. News at 10, your neighborhood is under attack. Put away the crack, before the crack puts you away. You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate. This is a love attack. I know
Ground Truth: I'd say the final verse is touching on the 80s crack epidemic and TV parenting. Don't just sit there while your community falls apartDon't sit your kids in front of the TV, and expect Mr. Wizard to raise themStay alive to be a role model, and raise your kids so you can relate to them and they can relate to the world.

Lyrics: Something has to change.; Un-deniable dilemma.; Boredom's not a burden; Anyone should bear.; ; Constant over stimu-lation numbs me; but I would not want; You any other way.; ; Cause; It's not enough.; I need more.; Nothing seems to satisfy.; I said; I don't want it.; ; I just need it.; To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.; Finger deep within the borderline.; ; Show me that you love me and that we belong together.; Relax, turn around and take my hand.; I can help you change; Tired moments into pleasure.; ; Say the word and we'll be; Well upon our way.; Blend and balance; Pain and comfort; ; Deep within you; Till you will not want me any other way.; But; It's not enough.; I need more.; Nothing seems to satisfy.; I said; I don't want it.; I just need it.; ; To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.; Knuckle deep inside the borderline.; This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.; Relax.

Relax. Turn around. Take my hand. He knows that she loves him, he knows that he deserves her, but she can't help him.
Ground Truth: to anyone who says its about love..... kill yourself.... read the lyrics (example : "How can it mean anything to meIf I really don't feel anything at all?" )2nd its about fingering to fisting a girl.... stink fist... c'mon people think about it.... think of the expression, "go get your dinky stinky".... any interpretation of love is wrong completely wrongSublimedude1992on June 06, 2009   
Lyrics: Eerie whispers; Trapped beneath my pillow; You won't let me see; Your memories; ; And I know you're in this room; I'm sure I heard you sigh; Floating in between; Where our worlds collide; ; It scares the hell out of me; And the end is all I can see; And it scares the hell out of me; And the end is all I can see; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa; ; And I know the moment's near; And there's nothing we can do; Look through a faithless eye; Are you afraid to die?; ; It scares the hell out of me; And the end is all I can see; And it scares the hell out of me; And the end is all I can see; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa; ; It scares the hell out of me; And the end is all I can see; And it scares the hell out of me; And the end is all I can see; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but the girl wants to be with him, but he can't. he's afraid to die, and he's scared that the girl won't let him see his memories, so he's trying to convince himself that he's not scared of dying. "Eerie whispers, Trapped beneath my pillow, You won’t let me see your memories, And I know you’re in this room, I’m sure I heard you sigh, Floating in between, Where our worlds collide." he’s scared of losing her, and the girl is scared that he won't be able to see her. "It scares the hell out of me, And the end is all I can see, Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, whoa." he's saying that he doesn't know what to do with himself, and that the end of his life is all he can see. "And I know the moment's near, And there's nothing we can do, Look through a faithless eye, Are you afraid of dying?" he's asking the girl if she's afraid of death, and if she is afraid of losing him, or if he's too scared to die. he wants her to know that she's scared of death and that he isn't afraid of it. he knows that if she dies, he'll be afraid of not being able to live with her, but that's just my take on it. "I know the moments near, and there’d nothing we could do. Look through the faithless eyes,Are you afraid to live?" he is saying that if he dies, it's too late, because he knows he's going to die soon. "But I know this room I'm sure I hear you sighFloating in between where their worlds collide" he's talking about how they're both in love, but they can't talk, because they're too scared of each other, and they're afraid that they won't see each other again, and it scares them so much that they don't want to be together anymore.

Lyrics: Topless models doing Semaphore; Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored; Illuminations on a rainy day; When she walks her footsteps sing a reckless serenade; ; I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need; Called up to listen to the voice of reason; And got the answering machine; ; The type of kisses where teeth collide; When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby; Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes; Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by; ; I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need; Called up to listen to the voice of reason; And got his answering machine; ; I left my message but did he fuck get back to me; And now I'm stuck still wondering how it's meant to be; ; Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade; Reckless serenade, reckless serenade; Reckless serenade, reckless serenade; Reckless serenade
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl who is a prostitute. He is the one who gets ignored by her. He wants her to leave his message, but she doesn't want to. She wants him to listen to the voice of reason and get his answering machine. I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need. Called up to listen, to the voices of reason. And now I'm stuck, still wondering how it's meant to be. The type of kisses where teeth collide. When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby. Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes. Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by. He's the one that gets ignored. The line "I left my message but did he fuck get back to me." He's saying that he's not sure what to do with his life and that he doesn't know how to deal with it. The last line is about how he feels about this girl. He feels like he's the only one who can help him. He can't help but feel like he needs her, but he can't get her back.
Ground Truth: I feel like this is a song about a girl who is attractive without even trying. Not even pretty necessarily, she just has a wonderful kind of aura that draws people in, obviously from the first four lines. I feel like the next four lines explain that she never strived to be like this, her serenade is reckless and almost oblivious. Then the person who's point of view this is from is trying to pinpoint exactly why he's so attracted to her and realises he has no idea, there's no reason behind it. "did he fuck get back to me". from her point of view, talking about how he meant nothing to her when she was his dream girl, i feel.

Ground Truth: Can’t believe no one commented on this song yet! Great song in my opinion, the singing, the guitar playing.. The lyrics aren’t that special but her voice (I thought it was a man honestly, unit I saw the video) is great and together with the guitar playing everything just sounds right. Is it strange that I’m comparing it with the White Stripes for a bit?

Lyrics: When I was young, younger than before; I never saw the truth hanging from the door; And now I'm older, see it face to face; And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place; ; And I was green, greener than the hill; Where flowers grew and the sun shone still; Now I'm darker than the deepest sea; Just hand me down, give me a place to be; ; And I was strong, strong in the sun; I thought I'd see when day was done; Now I'm weaker than the palest blue; Oh, so weak in this need for you
Sample outputs: I always thought this song was about a man who was in love with a woman, but he couldn't get over her. He realized that she was the one for him, and he had to move on. He thought he'd be able to get her back, but now that he's older, he doesn't know what to do. He doesn't want to be with her anymore. He wants to be alone with her, but she's too weak to help him. He's tired of waiting for her, and wants her to give him a place to be. He knows that he'll never be alone, and that's why he's so weak. "And I was strong, strong in the sunI thought I'd see when day was doneNow I'm weaker than the palest blueOh, so weak in this need for you"He knows that she's weak, but it's hard for him to let go of her, so he's trying to get over it. He feels like he can't do anything about it, because he's weak. He realizes that he has to get out of this relationship. "Oh so weak, in this needs for you." He knows he's not strong enough to get through the relationship, but that's how he feels. "I was green, greener than the hillWhere flowers grew and the sun shone still"He wants to get rid of her and get away from her. "Now I’m darker than the deepest seaJust hand me down, give me a place, to be"He's sick of being alone. He thinks he can get through it, but doesn't have the strength to do it. "When I was young, younger than beforeI never saw the truth hanging from the doorAnd now I'm older, see it face to face"He realizes that she doesn't love him anymore, and now he's ready to get up and clean the place. He can't let her go, because she's not there for him anymore. But he knows he'll always be there, even if it's only for a short time. He wonders if he'll ever see her again.
Ground Truth: one of my favorite drake songs... you're in a rough spot not knowing what or where to go and it's almost asking someone above for help and to just give me a place to be so that i feel i'm in place with the world. i'm lost and need direction. shelby_nubon May 30, 2007   
Lyrics: Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges; My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes; We tore up the walls, we slept on couches; We lifted this house, we lifted this house; Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south; Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth; I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine; We rattle this town, we rattle this scene; ; Oh, Anna Sun; Oh, Anna Sun; ; What do you know, this house is falling apart; What can I say, this house is falling apart; We got no money but we got h-heart; We're gonna rattle this ghost town; This house is falling apart; ; Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges; My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes; We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine; We rattle this town, we rattle this scene; ; Oh, Anna Sun; Oh, Anna Sun; ; What do you know, this house is falling apart; What can I say, this house is falling apart; We got no money but we got h-heart; We're gonna rattle this ghost town; Do you know this house is falling apart; What can I say, this house is falling apart; We got no money but we got h-heart; We're gonna rattle this ghost town; This house is falling apart; ; This house is falling apart; ; Live my life without; Station wagon rides; Fumbling round the back; Not one seatbelt on; Wait for summertime; Coming up for air; Now it's all I want; Now it's all I want; Live my life without; Coming up for air; Now it's all I want; I want everyone; Racing down the hill; I am faster than you; Wait for summertime; Wait for summertime; ; Oh, Anna Sun; Oh, Anna Sun, Sun; ; What do you know, this house is falling apart; What can I say, this house is falling apart; We got no money but we got h-heart; We're gonna rattle this ghost town; What do you know, this house is falling apart; What can I say, this house is falling apart; We got no money but we got h-heart; We're gonna rattle this ghost town; This house is falling apart; This house is falling apart; This house is falling apart; We're gonna rattle this ghost town; This house is falling apart; This house is falling apart
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a couple who have been together for a while, and are trying to get out of the house. They are going through a rough patch, and the house is falling apart, and they are trying desperately to make it work. They want to be together again, but they have no money, so they are going to "rattle this ghost town" because they are scared of the end of their relationship. "We got no money but we got h-heart" is a reference to the fact that they are not together anymore. They can't be together, because they don't have money. "I am faster than youWait for summertime" is saying that they will never be together because they will always be together. "Live my life without Station wagon ridesFumbling round the backNot one seatbelt on" is referring to their relationship, and how they are both going to rattle the town.
Ground Truth: I believe its talking about a relationship in the summer after high school... Partying, being young, but also changing....Basically remembering how awesome it was to be young and in love and not to care about the money or anyone else in towncraziesrunAkon September 16, 2012   
Lyrics: Stone love, she kneels before the grave; A brave son, who gave his life; To save the slogans; That hovers between the headstone and her eyes; For they penetrate her grieving; ; New love, a boy and girl are talking; New words, that only they can share in; New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts; To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning; ; Love is careless in its choosing; Sweeping over cross a baby; Love descends on those defenseless; Idiot love will spark the fusion; Inspirations have I none; Just to touch the flaming dove; All I have is my love of love; And love is not loving; ; Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and; Told of love, and how my God on high is; All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves; By the blindness that surrounds him; ; Love is careless in its choosing; Sweeping over cross a baby; Love descends on those defenseless; Idiot love will spark the fusion; Inspirations have I none; Just to touch the flaming dove; All I have is my love of love; And love is not loving
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a woman who is in love with a man, and the man is trying to convince her he loves her, but he doesn't want her to love him back. "Stone love, she kneels before the graveA brave son, who gave his lifeTo save the slogansThat hovers between the headstone and her eyesFor they penetrate her grievingNew love, a boy and girl are talkingNew words that only they can share inNew words, a love so strong it tears their heartsTo sleep through the fleeting hours of morningLove is careless in its choosingSweeping over cross a babyLove descends on those defenselessIdiot love will spark the fusionInspirations have I noneJust to touch the flaming doveAll I have is my love of loveAnd love is not lovingSoul love, the priest that tastes the wordAndTold of love, and how my God on high isAll love, though reaching up my loneliness evolvesBy the blindness that surrounds him"I think it's about how love is so hard to get over someone, and that it's hard to let go of the person you love. "I'm careless in it's choosing Sweeping over Cross a baby"I'm not sure if this is meant to be literal, but that is what I think. I think it could also be about someone who has been in love for a long time, and is still in love, but it's just not working out.
Ground Truth: He speaks to me with this song. I believe in One Love, the love of all. I can feel all this love for God and for life and everyone and everything that surrounds me. But I am missing being loved by one I love or a love I hope to find. It_Is_Shiningon July 13, 2008   
Lyrics: A worried man with a worried mind; No one in front of me and nothing behind; There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne; Got white skin, got assassin's eyes; I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies; I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train; Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose; Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose; People are crazy and times are strange; I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range; I used to care, but things have changed; This place ain't doing me any good; I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood; Just for a second there I thought I saw something move; Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag; Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag; Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove; Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too; Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through; People are crazy and times are strange; I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range; I used to care, but things have changed; I've been walking forty miles of bad road; If the bible is right, the world will explode; I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can; Some things are too hot to touch; The human mind can only stand so much; You can't win with a losing hand; Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet; Putting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street; People are crazy and times are strange; I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range; I used to care, but things have changed; I hurt easy, I just don't show it; You can hurt someone and not even know it; The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity; Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high; All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie; I'm love with a woman who don't even appeal to me; Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake; I'm not that eager to make a mistake; People are crazy and times are strange; I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range; I used to care, but things have changed
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a woman who doesn't even appeal to him. He's in a relationship with this woman, but he's not ready to give up on her. "I'm locked in tight, I'm out of rangeI used to care, but things have changedI've been walking forty miles of bad roadIf the bible is right, the world will explode"He's trying to convince himself that he doesn't care anymore. "Some things are too hot to touchThe human mind can only stand so muchYou can't win with a losing handFeel like falling in loveWith the first woman I meetPutting her in a wheel barrowAnd wheeling her down the street"He thinks he's in love, but it's too late. "People are crazy and times are strange"He doesn't know what to do with himself. He doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore. I think it's about a guy who feels like he's lost his love for this woman and wants to get over it. He wants to be with her, but doesn't have the courage to do it because he knows that he's too scared to go through with it. "Just for a second there I thought I saw something moveGonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug ragAin't no shortcuts, gonna dress in dragOnly a fool in here would think he's got anything to proveLotta water under the bridgeLotta other stuff tooDon't get up gentlemenI'm only passing through"I think the guy is trying to get away from the relationship. He thinks he can't do it anymore. He realizes that he has to get out of the relationship, and that there's no reason for it to change. "The next sixty seconds could be like an eternityGonna get lowdown, gonna fly highAll the truth in the world adds up to one big lieI'm love with the woman who don'teven appeal to meMr. Jinx and Miss LucyThey jumped in the lakeI'm not that eager to make a mistake"He is saying that he feels like his relationship has changed and that he needs to move on. He knows that it's not going to work out, because he's "out of range" but he knows it's going to happen.
Ground Truth: The last few years this song just keep popping up in my mind. Well before Covid. This is a person who is f***ed up with what's going on around him and noone can blame him... He has recorded this song well before it's time. What an amazing genius. Stellititaon November 26, 2020   
Lyrics: How you turn my world; You precious thing; You starve and near exhaust me; ; Everything I've done; I've done for you; I move the stars for no one; ; You've run so long; You've run so far; Your eyes can be so cruel; Just as I can be so cruel; Oh I do believe in you; Yes I do; ; Live without your sunlight; Love without your heartbeat; I, I can't live within you; I can't live within you; ; I, I can't live within you.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a woman. He loves her so much, that he can't live within her. He wants to be with her, but he knows that she can't be with him. "How you turn my worldYou precious thingYou starve and near exhaust meEverything I've doneI've done for youI move the stars for no oneYou've run so longYou've ran so farYour eyes can be so cruelJust as I can beSo cruelOh I do believe in youYes I doLive without your sunlightLove without your heartbeatI, I can't Live within youI can't LIVE within you"I think he's saying that he doesn't want to live without her, because he knows it's going to hurt him, and that he has to live with her. "I don't believe in her, yes I do"He doesn't know if he can live within himself. He doesn't believe he can. I think this means that he's scared of being with her again, but that's just what I think.
Ground Truth: I agree. It's not really a love song, and Jareth is not and can never be Sarah'se sweetheart. Jareth represents fantasy and pretend It is a song about Sarah realizing that it's time to trade the little-girl fantasy world of goblins and crystals and princesses and storybook heroes for the real grown-up world of responsibilities and appropriate behavior and social company. Sorry to burst the bubble -- or crack the crystal -- of any romantic maidens who wished Sarah had become Jareth's brideCuteSparkinaon October 30, 2008   Link1 Reply

Lyrics: Bite chunks out of me; You're a shark and I'm swimming; My heart still thumps as I bleed; And all your friends come sniffing; ; Triangles are my favorite shape; Three points where two lines meet; Toe to toe, back to back, let's go; My love it's very late; 'Til morning comes, let's tessellate; ; Go alone my flower; And keep my whole lovely you; Wild green stones alone my lover; And keep us on my heart; ; Three guns and one goes off, one's empty, one's not quick enough; One burn, one red, one grin; Search the graves while the camera spins; Chunks of you will sink down to seals; Blubber rich in mourning; They'll nosh you up,; yes they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say; You will still haunt me; ; Triangles are my favorite shape; Three points where two lines meet; Toe to toe, back to back, let's go; My love it's very late; 'Til morning comes, let's tessellate
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has a girlfriend who is in love with a shark but doesn't know what to do with her. He's trying to convince her that he loves her, but she doesn't feel the same for him. He wants her to stay with him, but he can't because he knows it's not going to work out. He doesn't want to leave her, so he decides to go back to her. The "triangles" part is a reference to the lines "three guns and one goes off, one empty, one's not quick enough, one burn, one red, one grin, Search the graves while the camera spins, chunks of you will sink down to seals, blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up, yes they'll Nosh the love away, but it's fair to say you will still haunt me." I think this line is about the guy who loves the girl, but can't seem to get over her, because she won't let him go. "Triangles are my favorite shape, three points where two lines meet, toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love it's very late, 'til morning comes, lets tessellate"I think he's talking about how he's telling her that she'll always haunt him, and that he'll always love her. "Go alone my flower, and keep my whole lovely you, Wild green stones, alone my lover, keep us on my heart"He's saying that he will always be there for her, even if she's gone, and she will always remember him. "Three guns, and one go off,one empty,one's not fast enough." He's saying she'll never be able to let go of him, even though he's gone. "One burn,one red,one grin,search the graves, while the cameras spins,chunks of your will sink, down to seal,BlubberRich in mourning"This line is him telling her he'll never forget her, and he's going to take care of her. But he's also saying that she will never be the same.

Sample outputs: this song is about how the music industry is so corrupt and corrupt that people don't even care about the music they listen to. it's not just about the money, it's about the fact that the world is corrupt and it's just not going to happen like that. its not just gonna happen like this. this is one of the best songs on the album. this song is the best in the world. i love it. i think its about how people are so fed up with the music that they don't care if it's popular or not. the music video is great, but i think the song is more about the people that listen to it, and the people who listen to the music. i don't think this song has anything to do with drugs, i think it's more of a message to people who are in the same situation as me. i just like the video, and i like the sound of this song, but the lyrics are just so annoying. i really like this song. it makes me want to scream. i mean, i'm a big fan of rap, but that's not what it means to me. I'm not a huge fan of pop music, but this is what i think of when i hear it. and i'm not saying it's a bad thing, i just think it is a great song. i can relate to it a lot. i'm just saying that it's the best song on the cd. i've heard it over and over again. i wish i could sing it to my friends. i hate it when people say that they hate rap, and that's just what i get outta it. but i love this song so much, i can't wait to hear the rest of the songs on this album. I don't know if anyone else has commented on this song yet, but it's one of my favorite songs off of the new album. it just makes me think of the times i've been around that track, and how i've listened to it so many times, and it just always makes me feel like i'm in the right place at the right time. i like it, i love the lyrics, i really do. it gives me chills when i listen to this song because it's so catchy and catchy. it reminds me of a time in my life when i was in high school and i was like "hey, this is my favorite song on this cd, i hope i get to hear it again soon." i just want to
Ground Truth: Hey guess what? SHE'S NOT IN HER BAND ANYMORE! Get over that. Ok? she's changed, you shouldn't be so effing rigid. I like No Doubt, i like her solo career. It's obviously possible to like both. I have a feeling you hate it just because she is trying something new. Anyway moving onThis song is so awesome. I knew it would be a single. This entire CD is like her just going at it and going single. I love the video how she covers her mouth when she says shit. It makes me laugh. It's also really really fun to dance to and imitate the pimped out harajuku girl's moves. ramzerron April 29, 2005   
Lyrics: Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something; Lightweights steppin' aside when we come in; Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping; People on the street then panic and start running; Words on loose leaf sheet, complete coming; I jump in my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumping; Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in; Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming; Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping; Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping; Risk something, take back what's yours; Say something that you know they might attack you for; 'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before; Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for; Like this war's really just a different brand of war; Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor; Like they understand you, in the back of their jet; When you can't put gas in your tank, these fuckers; Are laughing their way to the bank, and cashing their check; Asking you to have compassion and have some respect; For a leader so nervous in an obvious way; Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay; And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day; In the living room, laughing like, "What did he say?"; ; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; ; In my living room watching it, but I am not laughing; 'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen; The war is cold, the bold men take action; Have to react to get blown into fractions; At ten years old, there's something to see; Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep; Taken and bound and found later under a tree; I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'; Do you see the soldiers that are out today?; They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away; It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray; But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday; There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads; Inside your market, your shops, and your clothes; My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know; But enough pride inside not to let that show; My brother had a book he would hold with pride; A little red cover with a broken spine on the back; He hand-wrote a quote inside; "When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"; Meanwhile, the leader just talks away; Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay; ; The rest of the world watching at the end of the day; Both scared and angry, like "What did he say?"; ; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; ; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you

Ground Truth: schirs You're a gullable moron apparently. You're going to present what you think are facts to us at an attempt to make us perceive you're properly informed? Did you read that information out of TIME magazine. The Government lies to us constantly, and don't get me wrong, I love my Country, but politics are just lies, over lies, over lies. We waged war on the Middle east for oil, there is no other reason we'd of done that. Don't ever think it was for a justifiable reason. All the wars in the history of Earth have been because of Land (which entails resources) or religion. THAT is a fact. Also, it's a brilliant song, I'm not a huge fan of Linkin Park but they won me over with this one. I'm not an anti-bush but I understand what they're getting at. Bush is one dumb mother fucker and it's time we get someone in the office with their priorities straight. "When the Rich wage war, it's the poor who die". There isn't a better statement in that song, than that quote right there. crowleyyyon May 25, 2007   
Lyrics: My body is a cage; That keeps me from dancing with the one I love; But my mind holds the key; ; My body is a cage; That keeps me from dancing with the one I love; But my mind holds the key; ; I'm standing on a stage; Of fear and self-doubt; It's a hollow play; But they'll clap anyway; ; My body is a cage; That keeps me from dancing with the one I love; But my mind holds the key; ; You're standing next to me; My mind holds the key; ; I'm living in an age; That calls darkness light; Though my language is dead; Still the shapes fill my head; ; I'm living in an age; Whose name I don't know; Though the fear keeps me moving; Still my heart beats so slow; ; My body is a cage; That keeps me from dancing with the one I love; But my mind holds the key; ; You're standing next to me; My mind holds the key; My body is a...; ; My body is a cage; We take what we're given; Just because you've forgotten; That don't mean you're forgiven; ; I'm living in an age that; Screams my name at night; But when I get to the doorway; There's no one in sight; ; I'm living in an age; They laugh when I'm dancing with the one I love; But my mind holds the key; ; You're standing next to me; My mind holds the key; ; Set my spirit free; Set my spirit free; Set my body free; Set my body free; ; Set my spirit free; Set my body free
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a woman, but he is scared of being with her. "My body is a cageThat keeps me from dancing with the one I loveBut my mind holds the keyI'm living in an ageWhose name I don't knowThough the fear keeps me movingStill my heart beats so slow"He is afraid that he will never be able to move on from her, and he is afraid of the fear. "You're standing next to meMy mind holds The Key"He feels that he is in a cage, and that he can't move on. "Set my spirit freeSet my body free"He knows that he has to let go of her, but his mind won't let him. He wants to be with the woman he loves, but it's too late for him.
Ground Truth: I have heard many people say that they believe this song is about a man who is unable to obtain a woman because of some fault in him. What I love about this song is that while the lyrics are suggestive of this situation it is also fairly easy to apply them to others. This piece reminds me of an epic space saga, the trumpets, scale, atmosphere all evoke a Sci-Fi related theme; to me at least. I like to think this song is about an angel who has fallen to Earth, he is forever trapped in his human forum and has no way of ever continuing his role in Heaven. There is a way back however, hence his mind holding a key, a metaphor for some loop hole in achieving ascension. The age he inhabits is one that he does not know personally, the darkness and corruption are of a scale he has never seen, he tries to remember the basic morals he was taught yet they are nowhere to be seen in this new frightening land. The crescendo makes me feel as if he has achieved this goal of returning to Heaven, that, or he has died trying to so either way he no longer has to worry or fear this horrid world he has called home. Even if you dont agree keep this in mind next time youare listening to it. maxgygeron January 27, 2012   
Lyrics: Pick me up; Been bleeding too long; Right here, right now; I'll stop it somehow; ; I will make it go away; Can't be here no more; Seems this is the only way; I will soon be gone; These feelings will be gone; These feelings will be gone; ; Now I see the times they change; Leaving doesn't seem so strange; I am hoping I can find; Where to leave my hurt behind; All the shit I seem to take; All alone I seem to break; I have lived the best I can; Does this make me not a man?; ; Shut me off; I'm ready, heart stops; I stand alone; Can't be on my own; ; I will make it go away; Can't be here no more; Seems this is the only way; I will soon be gone; These feelings will be gone; These feelings will be gone; ; Now I see the times they change; Leaving doesn't seem so strange; I am hoping I can find; Where to leave my hurt behind; All the shit I seem to take; All alone I seem to break; I have lived the best I can; Does this make me not a man?; ; Am I going to leave this place?; What is it I'm running from?; Is there nothing more to come?; Is there only black in space?; Am I going to take it's place?; Am I going to win this race?; I guess God's up in this place?; What is it that I've become?; Is there something more to come?; More to come; ; Now I see the times they change; Leaving doesn't seem so strange; I am hoping I can find; Where to leave my hurt behind; All the shit I seem to take; All alone I seem to break; I have lived the best I can; Does this make me not a man?; Now I see the times they change; Leaving doesn't seem so strange; I am hoping I can find; Where to leave my hurt behind; All the shit I seem to take; All alone I seem to break; I have lived the best I can; Does this make me not a man?
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who is going through a hard time in his life. He is trying to find a way out of it, but he cant. He wants to get out of this mess he's in. He doesn't want to go back to the mess he was in, and he doesn't know how to deal with it. He's trying to figure out where to go from there. He feels like he has no choice but to leave the mess. He just wants to move on. He knows he has to leave, but it's hard for him to do that.
Ground Truth: I just heard this song today and already I love it. I'm pretty sure the song's just simply about being depressed, and just waiting to feel better. But also the fact that you wonder if you're still 'manly' when you're depressed. Ximmermanon July 29, 2008

Why would he believes in meWhy would he have believed in me?" I look at the sky and there may not be anything to see, but if he did, he would believe in himself, and he would do anything for the people he loves, and if he didn't, he wouldn't believe himself, because he would never believe in the people that he loves. I look down to the heavens, there might be nothing to see. But if I dont believe in you, why will he believein me? I think that this song is talking about how we are all going to die, and that we all are going to end up in hell, and when we do, there will be no one to see it, because we will all die. I know this because I have been there, and I know what I've been going through, but I just want to know what you think. I think this is a pretty good song.
Ground Truth: I have an interesting take on this song. I believe this song is a sequel to Pray for Plagues from the girls point of view. Depending on how you interpret Pray for Plagues it all basically comes down to Oli knowing a whore and how it messed up her life. If you look closely he uses some of the same words. Pray For Plagues= "Eradicate this disease"Chelsea Smile= "This disease is getting worse"Pray for Plagues= "Count your fucking blessings"Chelsea Smile= "I've counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse"Pray for Plagues= "Pray for plagues"Chelsea Smile= "Pray for forgiveness"Before Oli says, "Eradicate this disease" he says "Christ I'm asking you for just one thing." That one thing would be to help the whore he knows. In Chelsea Smile when he says, "I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see. But if I don't believe in Him, why would He believe in me?" I believe it's from the girls point of view and her internal conflict with God and His existence and/or His love for her. Furthermore, when Oli says, "I may look happy, but honestly dear, the only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear. I see the vultures, they watch me bleed, they lick their lips as all the shame spills out of me." I think the girl is saying how she regrets her actions so much it's almost impossible to make her smile/happy. I think the vultures he talks about are men who see she's filled with shame and see her as an easy target to be taken advantage of. "They lick their lips, as all the shame spills out of me." Maybe the girl is venting her problems to a man and all he sees is an easy target as he licks his lips. Sorry if I wasn't clear on anything but I really love this song and thought I'd throw this out. I don't know if it's correct but I'd love to read more interpretations. theendisnighon November 30, 2008   Link1 Reply

Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who lost his virginity to a girl named georgie. This song is a tribute to her. It's about a man who is in love with a girl who has lost her virginity to him. He loves her, but she doesn't want him to cry. He doesn't know how to deal with it. He wants her to cry, because he knows it's going to be okay. He knows she won't cry, but he knows she has to get over it.
Ground Truth: LMFAO... really its been hilarious reading all of these entries. I find it fascinating that with all the information out there on the internet people still show up here guessing and surmising, along with the the odd teenager who just wants to come on here and say the naughty words his parents wont let him say (infectionspread... go take some ritalin and stfu). The "true" lyrics in the translation are:No, Woman, Non Cry. NON not no. "Non" is the jamaican slang-shortened version of the English "Don't". For some reason when the albums were first printed they said "No Woman No Cry", but after awhile those who were close to Bob had the song re-labeled as NoHow the F can you not get it after "don't shed no teears" and "dry your eyes"???? motorbreath23on September 11, 2009   
Lyrics: This world will never be; What I expected; And if I don't belong; Who would have guessed it; I will not leave alone; Everything that I own; To make you feel like it's not too late; It's never too late; ; Even if I say; It'll be alright; Still I hear you say; You want to end your life; Now and again we try; To just stay alive; Maybe we'll turn it all around; 'Cause it's not too late; It's never too late; ; No one will ever see; This side reflected; And if there's something wrong; Who would have guessed it; And I have left alone; Everything that I own; To make you feel like; It's not too late; It's never too late; ; Even if I say; It'll be alright; Still I hear you say; You want to end your life; Now and again we try; To just stay alive; Maybe we'll turn it all around; 'Cause it's not too late; It's never too late; ; The world we knew; Won't come back; The time we've lost; Can't get back; The life we had; Won't be ours again; ; This world will never be; What I expected; And if I don't belong; ; Even if I say; It'll be alright; Still I hear you say; You want to end your life; Now and again we try; To just stay alive; Maybe we'll turn it all around; 'Cause it's not too late; It's never too late; Maybe we'll turn it all around; 'Cause it's not too late; It's never too late (It's never too late); It's not too late; It's never too late
Sample outputs: I love this song. It reminds me of my best friend. We were going through a lot of stuff in our lives and she was trying to help me through it, but she didn't want me to help her. She told me she was going to do whatever it takes to make me feel better, but I couldn't help but cry everytime I heard it. It's one of the best songs ever. I can't wait for her to come back to me.
Ground Truth: I think this song was about how his WIFE, and like something happened to her when she was young? And she doesn't want to live anymore.. Because if you see the YouTube clip, there's this little girl, and this Woman on the bed, and the butterflies get released after like yeah.. I don't know for sure. I heard it from somewhere though. But I really think this song is good(: Especially the first verse. hahah. [:lala101on March 16, 2008   
Lyrics: Who's seen Jezebel?; She was born to be a woman I would know; And hold like a breeze half as tight as both our eyes closed; And who's seen Jezebel?; She when walking where the cedars line the road; Her blouse on the ground where the dogs were hungry, roaming, sayin',; "Wait, we swear we'll love you more,; And holy Jezebel,; It's we, we that you are for, only."; Who's seen Jezebel?; She was born to be a woman we could blame; Make me a beast half as brave I'd be the same; Who's seen Jezebel?; She was gone before I ever got to say,; "Lay here my love, you're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel."; ; Who's seen Jezebel?; Where the mountain lasts as long as I can wait; Wait like the dawn, how it aches to me the day; Who's seen Jezebel?; She was certainly the spark for all I've done; The window was wide, she could see the dogs come running, sayin',; "Wait, we swear we'll love you more,; And holy Jezebel,; It's we, we that you are for, only."
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who has been in love with a woman for a long time and she was born to be a woman he would knowAnd hold like a breeze half as tight as both our eyes closedAnd who's seen Jezebel? She when walking where the cedars line the roadHer blouse on the ground where the dogs were hungry, roaming, sayin'Wait, we swear we'll love you moreAnd holy JezebelsIt's we, we that you are for, onlyWho's seenJezebelShe was bornTo be a women we could blameMake me a beast half as brave I'd be the sameWho's been there? She was gone before I ever got to sayLay here my love, you're the only shape I'll pray to, JezebELWho's Seen Jezeble? Where the mountain lasts as long as I can waitWait like the dawnHow it aches to me the dayThe window was wide, she could see the dogs come running, saying'Wait'We swear we will love youMoreAnd holy jezebelIt's We, we That You Are For, OnlyI think it's about a guy who has finally found a woman who he can love and be with for the rest of his life. She was certainly the spark for all I've doneThe window, was wideShe could see that the dogs came running, say'Wait! We swear We'll love You MoreAnd Holy JezebelleIt'sWe, We that You Are for, Only'I think he's talking about a girl who has found someone who will love her more than he ever could before and that she will love him more than she can ever love anyone else. He's saying that she is the only woman he will ever love, and that he will never be able to love her as much as she loves him because she will never love him the same. I think this is about him finding a woman that he can be with and he will always love her, and she will always be there for him no matter what.
Ground Truth: A lot of people have written some very thoughtful, and thought provoking things. Especially the person who wrote that in a sick, twisted way the dogs benefited the most from Jezebel's existence and so this is their love song for her. Taking it a few steps further:The song is not written from the dogs' (or fate's) point of view. It is still sang from the narrator's perspective, which brings me to..Who was Jezebel? A Phonecian princess married to Ahab, yet she refused to give up her religion and defer to her husband's. Strength like that was blasphemy in the days when Christianity on the rise. A woman strong enough to run a godly prophet out of her land was unheard of. So when the narrator, someone I see as a wishful thinker in the present day, says, "She was gone before I ever got to say, lay here my love, you're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel," what I hear is, "You cannot convince me to abandon my god for yours, but your strength and spirit I can recognize, and that is something of yours I can love wholly." I won't go into every lyric because this song has actually had some really great input from listeners and I feel like there's no need to go into it verse-by-verse. Really, great interpretations, everybody. virtuallypainlesson February 18, 2008   
Lyrics: I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together; See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly; I'm crying; ; Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come; Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody tuesday; Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long; I am the eggman, they are the eggmen; I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob; ; Mister City Policeman sitting pretty little policemen in a row; See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run; I'm crying, I'm crying; I'm crying, I'm crying; Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye; ; Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess; Boy, you been a naughty girl you let your knickers down; I am the eggman, they are the eggmen; I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob; Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun; ; If the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the english rain; I am the eggman, they are the eggmen; I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob; Expert textpert choking smokers; don't you thing the joker laughs at you; See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied; ; I'm crying; Semolina pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower; Elementary penguin singing Hari Krishna; Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe; I am the eggman, they are the eggmen; I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob; Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob g'goo
Sample outputs: I think it's about a group of people who are trying to get the attention they deserve from society, but they can't get it because they are too busy trying to make money. "I am he as you are heAs you are meAnd we are all togetherSee how they run like pigs from a gunSee how them flyI'm cryingSitting on a cornflakeWaiting for the van to comeCorporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody tuesdayMan, you been a naughty boyYou let your face grow longI am the eggmanThey are the eggmenI am a walrusGoo goo g'joobGoo g'Joob"I think the walrus is a reference to the police and the police. "Mister City Policeman sitting pretty little policemen in a rowSee howThey fly like Lucy in the Sky See how they fly I'm crying"The police are the people that are getting the attention and attention from society. "Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess Boy, you had a naughty girl you let your knickers down"The walrus has been naughty and she let her knickers go. "CrabalockerFishwifePornography priestessBoy, you've been a naughty girl You let your hands down"This refers to the people who have been naughty, and they are the ones who are taking the money and the money from the money. The walrus and the pornography are saying that the people are the "pornography" of society. They are also saying that they are going to get a tan from standing in the english rain"If the sun don't come, you get the tan from sitting in the English rainI think this is referring to the way people are getting money from society and how they are getting a tan because of what they are doing. "Man, You should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe"This is just my take on the song.
Ground Truth: if you re-watch alice in wonderland, which many haven't seen in years, you will notice that this song has direct symbolism to the story that tweedle dee and tweedle dum tell about the walrus, the carpenter, and the clams. It also has a double meaning in reference to the gorvernmet; the walrus being the big man, the eggman/carpenter being the people (us). katyfoster21on July 01, 2008

Lyrics: Fathers hands were lined with dirt; From long days in the field; ; And mothers hands are serving meals; In a cafe on Main Street; With mouths to feed, just trying to keep; Clothing on our backs; And all I hear about is; How it's so bad, it's so bad; It's too bad, stupid; ; Too late, so wrong, so long; It's too bad that; We had no time to rewind; Let's walk, let's talk; ; (Let's talk); You left without saying goodbye; Although I'm sure you tried; You call her house from time to time; To make sure we're alive; But you weren't there; ; Right when I'm needing you the most; And now I dream about it; ; How it's so bad, it's so bad; It's too bad, stupid; Too late, so wrong, so long; It's too bad that; ; We had no time to rewind; Let's walk, let's talk; It's too bad, stupid; Too late, so wrong, so long; ; It's too bad that; ; We had no time to rewind; Let's walk, let's talk; (Let's talk); For all those hands are lined with guilt; ; For tearing us apart; Guess it turned out in the end; Just look at where we are; We made it out; We still got clothing on our backs; And now I scream about it; How it's so bad, it's so bad; It's so bad, it's so bad; It's too bad, stupid; Too late, so wrong, so long; It's too bad that; We had no time to rewind; Let's walk, let's talk; It's so bad, it's too bad, it's too bad; Too late, so wrong, so long; It's too bad that; We had no time to rewind; Let's walk, let's talk; No time; Last one; Let's go
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a couple who broke up. They are trying to make it work, but they can't. They don't have time to talk to each other, so they have no time to rewind. They just have to deal with the fact that they have to face the reality that they are not going to be together for a long time. They can't be together forever. They have to move on, but it's too late, so wrong, so long. It's too bad, stupid, too late. They've gone through so much in their lives that they've forgotten who they are, and they're trying to figure out how they're going to get through it, and how they are going to make the most of it.
Ground Truth: This song really hits home for me as it does with a lot of people, my dad has never really been around for me and my sister. First time I saw him in 3 years was a couple months ago at my grandmothers funeral. This year was the also the first time he called me on my birthday in 4 years. He never really said goodbye and he calls the house every once in a while(You left without saying goodbye although I'm sure you tried, You call the house from time to time to make sure we're alive).

Lyrics: Picture yourself in a boat on a river; With tangerine trees and marmalade skies; Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly; A girl with kaleidoscope eyes; ; Cellophane flowers of yellow and green; Towering over your head; Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes; And she's gone; ; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Ah, ah; ; Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain; Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies; Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers; That grow so incredibly high; ; Newspaper taxis appear on the shore; Waiting to take you away; Climb in the back with your head in the clouds; And you're gone; ; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Ah, ah; ; Picture yourself on a train in a station; With plasticine porters with looking glass ties; Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile; The girl with kaleidoscope eyes; ; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Ah, ah; ; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Ah, ah; ; Lucy in the sky with diamonds; Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Sample outputs: This song is about a girl named lucy. She's a girl with kaleidoscope eyes. She was a girl who used to be obsessed with LSD, but then she fell in love with a guy who was obsessed with her too. She got into a fight with him, and he tried to kill her, but she didn't want to kill him. She tried to get him to kill himself, but he couldn't do anything about it, so she killed herself. It was a sad song, but it made me cry. I love it.
Ground Truth: You guys are all reading way too much into it. Who cares what this song is about? In my opinion it's still a good song. WhyDidISignUp?on September 18, 2014   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Hold my head; We'll trampoline; Finally through the roof; On to somewhere near; And far in time; ; Velouria; Her covering; Travelling career; She can really move; Oh velveteen; ; My Velouria, my Velouria; Even I'll adore you; My Velouria; Even I'll adore you; My Velouria; ; Say to me; Where have you been; Finally through the roof; And how does lemur skin; Reflect the sea?; ; We will wade in the shine of the ever; We will wade in the shine of the ever; We will wade in the tides of the summer; Every summer; Every summer; Every; My Velouria; My Velouria; ; Forever green; I know she's here; In California; I can see the tears; Of shastasheen; ; My Velouria, my Velouria; Even I'll adore you; My Velouria
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who loves a guy, but doesn't want to be with him because she doesn't feel the same way about him. "Even I'll adore you, my Velouria" means that she loves him, and he loves her even though he doesn't love her anymore. "Say to me where have you beenFinally through the roofAnd how does lemur skinReflect the sea? We will wade in the shine of the everWe will wades in the sun of the dayEvery summerEvery summer" means he'll spend the summer with her, and that he'll be there for her. "Forever greenI know she's hereIn CaliforniaI can see the tearsOf shastasheen" means she's in California, but he can't see her anymore, because she's still in California.

Lyrics: Swollen with liquid; Ready to burst; A load of my lymph; Will quench this dead bosy's thirst; One month in the grave; Twisted and half decayed; She turned a putrid yellow; I pissed in her maggot filled asshole; Fucking the rotting; My semen is bleeding; The smell of decay; Seeps from her genital cavity; The smell was unbearable; As i unburied her; I cum blood; From my erection; I feel it run; Down her throat; Swallow; Eyes glassy and vacant; Body dug up to play with; Skin greasy and naked; Tonguing her rotten anus; I need a live woman; To fill with my fluid; A delicate girl; To mutilate, fuck and kill; Her body exceptional; She thought I was normal; But I wanted more; I came blood inside of her; Choking on the clot; Gagging on the snot; Gushing blood from her mouth; Bloody gel leaking out!; Body buried in a shallow grave; Unmarked for none to find; The sickness i have left behind; Undetected go my crimes; The greatest thrill of my life; To slit my own cock with a knife; Violent; Climax; Serging serum; On; My; Skin; Back from the dead; I am resurrected to spew; PUTREFACTION!!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't like him because he's hot and he doesn't want to have sex with her. He wants her to kill him, but he can't have her, so he kills her. The last verse seems to be talking about how he wants to kill her, and how he feels like he has to get rid of her, but that's just my opinion. That's what I think.
Ground Truth: This song is absolutely wonderful :) I love the metaphors and the rhyming language used. I went to sleep listening to this last night, its sooo romantic :) I love Cannonball Course. Their songs are kewl. pinky3589on August 15, 2005   
Lyrics: Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay; Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did; All all five horizons, revolved around her soul...; As the Earth to the Sun; Now, the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn; ; Ooh, and all I taught her was... everything; Ooh, I know she gave me all... that she wore; And now my bitter hands, chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything; All the pictures have all been washed in black; Tattooed everything; ; I take a walk outside; I'm surrounded by some kids at play; I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?; ; Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin around my head; I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning; How quick the Sun can drop away; And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass... of what was everything; All the pictures have, all been washed in black; Tattooed everything; ; All the love gone bad, turned my world to black; Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be, yeah; ; I know that someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star; In somebody else's sky...; But why, why, why can't it be... can't it be mine?; Ah, yeah
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who loves a girl, but she's gone and he can't see her again. He's trying to find her again, but he knows she'll never be the same again, and he knows that someday she'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why can't it be? Why can't its be mine? Ah, yeah. I love this song so much.
Ground Truth: The ending lyrics of the song are powerful. Anyone who has ever been in love can feel the last lines of the song. Pearl Jam created a song that I feel must be covered. I like DMB's and Staind cover. I'm still ready for more covers. It's not so much Pearl Jam as it is just a song with a powerful ending that I never get tired of. phily911on December 12, 2004

Lyrics: Come as you are, as you were; As I want you to be; As a friend, as a friend; As an old enemy; ; Take your time, hurry up; The choice is yours, don't be late; Take a rest as a friend; As an old; ; Memoria, memoria; Memoria, memoria; ; Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach; As I want you to be; As a trend, as a friend; As an old; ; Memoria, memoria; Memoria, memoria; ; And I swear that I don't have a gun; No I don't have a gun; No I don't have a gun; ; Memoria, memoria; Memoria, memoria; (No I don't have a gun); ; And I swear that I don't have a gun; No I don't have a gun; No I don't have a gun; No I don't have a gun; No I don't have a gun; ; Memoria, memoria
Sample outputs: I think the song is about a friend who has passed away. "Come as you are, as you wereAs I want you to beAs a friend, as a friendAs an old enemyTake your time, hurry upThe choice is yours, don't be lateTake a rest, as an oldMemoria, memoriaMemoria"Come doused in mud, soaked in bleachAs I wanted you toBeAs a trend, as A FriendAs an Old enemy"I think this is a reference to the fact that a friend is a friend of a friend and they are going through a rough patch in their life. "And I swear that I don't have a gunNo, I Don't Have A Gun"I don't know if that's what the song means to me, but it's just my opinion. I love this song. I can't wait for the album.
Ground Truth: OK… I have a different take on this song. I have always thought this was a song about a guy who had a good friend who was a girl. Not a girlfriend, but a cool chick he just hung out with or who hung out with his group of friends. Perhaps on a night out, things “just happened” and they slept together. Maybe the girl’s a little confused or pissed. In the song, the guy is saying, “Everything things cool. I just want to be friends like we were. And I swear, I’m not just trying to sleep with you again.” Let’s look at the song:The first part says, “Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be. As a friend… As an old enemy.” Translation = “Come hang out with me as the friend that you are, as you were before we slept together. I really want us to be friends. I know you’re kinda pissed that I don’t want more, but let’s put that behind us.”“Take your time, hurry up…don’t be late… as a friend. As an old memory” Translation = “Everything’s cool. Come hang out with me (just don’t be late) as a friend, as I remember our friendship before we slept together.”The second part says, “Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach. As I want you to be. …as a friend. As an old memory.” The lines “dowsed in mud” and “soaked in bleach” represent opposite ends of the spectrum. Translation = “Come hang out with me. However you want to be is cool with me. Let’s just be friends as I remember.”Lastly, we have, “And I swear that I don't have a gun. No, I don't have a gun...” A gun is often used as a phallic symbol. Translation = “And I swear, I’m not just trying to sleep with you again. Honestly!.”So what do you think of this interpretation??? Anyway, this is a great song. I really like playing it on the guitar. Sometimes it’s impossible to make your guitar sound like the song because there are so many effects and/or post processing. This song is pure Fender Strat plugged into an amp! Just play close to the bridge for that twangy sound. Atomic_Dawgon January 26, 2006   
Lyrics: Out of gas, out of road; Out of car, I don't know how I'm going to go; And I had a drink the other day; Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away; ; I had a drink the other day; I had a lot to say; And I said...; ; You will come down soon too; You will come down too soon; You will come down soon too; You will come down, you'll come down, come down; ; You will come down soon too; You will come down too soon; You will come down soon too; Soon enough you will come down, come down; ; Out of gas, out of road; Out of car, I don't know how I'm going to go; And I had a drink the other day; Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away; ; I had a drink the other day; I had a lot to say; And I said...; ; You will come down soon too; You will come down too soon; You will come down soon too; Soon enough you will come down, come down; ; You will come down soon too; You will come down too soon; You'll come down, come down; You'll come down, come down
Sample outputs: "Out of gas, out of roadOut of car, I don't know how I'm going to goAnd I had a drink the other dayOpinions were like kittens, I was giving them away"This line makes me think that he's talking to himself. "I had a lot to sayAnd I saidYou will come down soon too"He's talking about how he doesn't know what to do next, but he's saying that he has a lot of to say, and he's giving it away. He's saying he's going to give it up, and that it's not going to be easy.
Ground Truth: I hate when people think every song is about drugs. But anyway, I feel this is about some guy who has hit rock bottom and has nowhere else to go, and everyone else that looks down upon him he states that they will "come down soon too". GlitchTheViruson January 07, 2006   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Life is hard; And so am I; You'd better give me; Something so I don't die; ; Novocaine for the soul; Before I sputter out; ; Life is white; And I am black; Jesus and His lawyer; Are coming back; ; Oh, my darling will you be here?; Before I sputter out; ; Guess, who's living here; With the great undead; This paint by numbers life; Is fucking with my head, once again; ; Life is good; And I feel great; 'Cause mother says I was; A great mistake; Novocaine for the soul; You'd better give me; Something to fill the hole; Before I sputter out
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is addicted to opiates. He can't stop thinking about it, but he has to stop thinking of it. He needs something to fill the hole before he sputters out. He's saying that if he doesn't do it, he's going to die. He wants something to take his mind off of it, something to make him feel better about himself. I think the line "this paint by numbers life is fucking with my head once again" is a reference to the fact that he can't take it anymore, and he's starting to think about killing himself. "life is hard, and so am IYou'd better give meSomething so I don't die" is about how he's trying to kill himself, but it's hard because he's afraid of death. "Life is white, and I am blackJesus and his lawyerAre coming back" is saying that he's gonna die, and that he needs to die before he can die. "Guess who's living hereWith the great undeadThis paint by Numbers lifeIs fucking with his headOnce again" means that he has no idea what he's doing, and it's killing him. " Life is good and I feel great'Cause mother says I was a great mistake" is talking about how his mother is telling him that he should kill himself before he dies. "No, my darling will you be here? Before I sputter out" is referring to how he thinks he's killing himself and that his mother has to give him something to kill him. He feels great, but his mother says he was a mistake. "Death is white" is him thinking about death, and his mother thinks that he shouldn't die. The line "Jesus and His lawyer Are Coming Back" refers to his mother saying that his family is coming back, and Jesus and his attorney are coming back. In the second verse, he thinks that they're coming back to him, and they're going to come back, so he's just going to have to take the drugs and kill himself.
Ground Truth: Yeah, I don't think the hole has any sexual connotation, just hole, as in a void in his life where nothing is happening and it's just vacant. The song's about wanting something just to numb the pain of all the bad stuff that happens to you, as novocaine is routinely used by dentists as an anesthetic. In a nutshell, it's about just needing an escape from the daily, crappy trials and tribulations that you have to go through and wishing something extraordinary and wonderful would happen to break the monotony. suclid003on April 19, 2006   
Lyrics: My friend and me; Looking through her red box of memories; Faded I'm sure; But love seems to stick in her veins you know; ; Yes, there's love if you want it; Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord; Yes, there's love if you want it; Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord; My Lord; ; Why can't you see; That nature has its way of warning me?; Eyes open wide; Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye; ; Yes, there's love if you want it; Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord; Yes, there's love if you want it; Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord; My Lord; ; Sinking faster than a boat without a hull, my Lord; Dreaming about the day when I can see you there; My side; By my side; ; Here we go again and my head is gone, my Lord; I stop to say, "Hello"; 'Cause I think you should know; By now; By now; By now; By now; By now; By now; ; Oh, by now; Oh, by now; Oh, by now; Oh, by now; Oh, by now; Oh, by now; Oh, by now; Oh, by now
Sample outputs: I think this song is about someone who is about to commit suicide. He is in love with his friend, and he wants to be with her. He wants to give it to her, but he can't because of the nature of the world. He doesn't know what to do. He knows that the nature has its way of warning him. He can't stop to say hello cause I think you should know, by now.
Ground Truth: I think this song is about a friend of his. Somone who has an addiction to drugs and finds love by injection into her veins. I think he sits with his friend and they look through old photos at a time when life was better and his friend was happy. His seems to be saying to her "Theres love here with me if you want it", and hoping that one day he will see his friend standing by his side drug free and happy again. At the moment though he feels as though either he or his friend "is sinking faster that a boat without a hull". Life is slipping away. simon71590on June 15, 2012   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Please come now I think I'm falling; I'm holding on to all I think is safe; It seems I found the road to nowhere; And I'm trying to escape; ; I yelled back when I heard thunder; But I'm down to one last breath; And with it let me say, let me say; ; Hold me now; I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking; Maybe six feet ain't so far down; ; I'm looking down now that it's over; Reflecting on all of my mistakes; I thought I found the road to somewhere; Somewhere in his grace; ; I cried out, heaven save me; But I'm down to one last breath; And with it let me say; Let me say; ; Hold me now; I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking; Maybe six feet ain't so far down; Hold me now; I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking; Maybe six feet ain't so far down; Im so far down; ; Sad eyes follow me; But I still believe there's something left for me; So please come stay with me; 'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me; For you and me; For you and me; ; Hold me now; I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking; ; Hold me now; I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking; Maybe six feet ain't so far down; Hold me now; I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking; Maybe six feet ain't so far down; ; Please come now I think I'm falling; I'm holding on to all I think is safe
Sample outputs: This song is about a person who has lost a loved one and is trying to get back to the person he loved. The person is going through a rough patch in their life and is asking God for help. "Please come now I think I'm fallingI'm holding on to all I think is safeIt seems I found the road to nowhereAnd I'm trying to escapeI yelled back when I heard thunderBut I'm down to one last breathAnd with it let me sayLet me sayHold me nowI'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinkingMaybe six feet ain't so far downI'm looking down now that it's overReflecting on all of my mistakesI thought I found a road to somewhereSomewhere in his graceI cried out, heaven save meBut Im down toone last breath and with it, let meSayLet me Say"The person is praying to God to save them from death. He is asking for God to help them. He wants them to stay with him. "Hold me NOWI'm 6 feetFrom the edgeAnd I’m thinkingMaybe Six feet ain’t so farDown"The singer is saying that he is going to die.

The singer is asking him to come back and be with them. The song is a prayer to God.
Ground Truth: creed continually makes allusions to god throughout this piece liek almost every other ones of their songs. but whether u take to see the song through its 1st or 2nd "layer" it is up to u. i think by writing their songs this way creed means to show a profound spiritualness in life and its happenings. i hope this song becomes their next huge hitIMMORTAL_-_SOULon May 14, 2002

Lyrics: Too big, too small?; Size does matter, after all; Zu groß, zu klein?; Er könnte etwas größer sein; ; Mercedes-Benz und Autobahn; Alleine in das Ausland fahren; Reise, reise, Fahrvergnügen; Ich will nur Spaß, mich nicht verlieben; ; Just a little bit; Just a little bitch; ; You've got a pussy; I have a dick; So what's the problem?; Let's do it quick; ; So take me now before it's too late; Life's too short, so I can't wait; Take me now, oh, don't you see?; I can't get laid in Germany; ; Too short, too tall?; Doesn't matter, one size fits all; Zu groß, zu klein?; Der Schlagbaum sollte oben sein; ; Schönes Fräulein, Lust auf mehr; Blitzkrieg mit dem Fleischgewehr; Schnaps im Kopf, du holde Braut; Steck Bratwurst in dein Sauerkraut; ; Just a little bit; Be my little bitch; ; You've got a pussy; I have a dick; So what's the problem?; Let's do it quick; ; So take me now before it's too late; Life's too short, so I can't wait; Take me now, oh, don't you see?; I can't get laid in Germany; ; Germany; Germany; ; You've got a pussy; I have a dick; So what's the problem?; Let's do it quick; ; You've got a pussy; I have a dick; So what's the problem?; Let's do it quick; ; You've got a pussy; I have a dick; So what's the problem?; Let's do it quick; ; So take me now before it's too late; Life's too short, so I can't wait; Take me now, oh, don't you see?; I can't get laid in Germany
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is too big for a girl and he has a dick, but he can't get laid in Germany. He is too short and too tall to be able to get laid with a girl, and he doesn't want to have sex with her, so he wants to be with her. He wants her to know that he loves her, and that he is willing to do anything for her, even if it means having sex with a woman. He doesn't care if she's a pussy or a dick. He just wants to make her feel good, even though he knows it's not the right thing to do.
Ground Truth: You've got a pussy, I have a dick,So what's the problem? Let's do it quick! what you think about this:You've got an enemy, I have weaponSo what's the problem? Let's transfer money! Like Amerika...social satire..??? harry2010on May 14, 2010   
Lyrics: Tough girl; In the fast lane; No time for love; No time for hate; No drama, no time for games; Tough girl whose soul aches; ; I'm at home, on my own; Check my phone, nothing, though; Act busy, order in; Pay TV, it's agony; ; I may cry, ruining my makeup; Wash away all the things you've taken; And I don't care if I don't look pretty; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; Big girls cry when their heart is breaking; ; Tough girl, I'm in pain; It's lonely at the top, blackouts and airplanes; And I still pour you a glass of champagne; Tough girl whose soul aches; ; I'm at home, on my own; Check my phone, nothing, though; Act busy, order in; Pay TV, it's agony; ; I may cry, ruining my makeup; Wash away all the things you've taken; And I don't care if I don't look pretty; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; ; I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up; I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up; I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up; I wake up alone; ; I may cry, ruining my makeup; Wash away all the things you've taken; And I don't care if I don't look pretty; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking; Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy but he doesnt care about her because he loves her so much and he doesnt want to hurt her because she doesnt care what he thinks of her. "I may cry ruining my makeupWash away all the things you've takenAnd I dont care if I don't look prettyBig girls cry when their hearts are breakingBig girls cried when their heart is breaking"i think that means that she is in a relationship with this guy and she doesn't care about how she looks or what she does or who she likes. "Big girl cry when they're breaking" i think means that the guy is hurting her and she is trying to get over him but she doesnt want him to get hurt. "big girls cry" means that he wants to be with her but she can't be with him because she wants him to be there for her and that she loves him and wants to make him happy. "tough girl i'm in painIt's lonely at the topBlackouts and airplanesAnd I still pour you a glass of champagneTough girl whose soul aches" means she is going through a tough time in her life and she wants to hold on to him and let him know how much she cares about him and how much he cares for her. I think this is saying that she feels like she has been through a lot of pain and this guy is always there when she needs him and she knows that he isnt going to be able to help her out. "i wake up, i wake upI wake up alone" meaning that she wakes up and realizes that she has to move on and move on with her life because she has already moved on. i think that this is also saying that even though she is a tough girl, she will still love him and will always love him regardless of what she thinks of him.
Ground Truth: This song is very literal. There aren't many veiled messages, just a lot of pulse-words that are meant to deliver the meaning with little else. Imagine being in a long-term relationship for quite some time, and then it ends, and you are left to your own devices, leading your own life apart from them (especially with the aspect of being a "tough girl" and not crying).. she says she comes home from work or whatever on her own, no one has attempted to contact her all day, she pretends to be busy anyway as if it doesn't matter that no one is trying to see her, order some take-out, watch TV all night (informercials = pay TV...), and then wake up alone only to repeat the process. She says it quite literally that it's agony to be so alone with so many standards to uphold, to look strong and tough, to look unbothered by a major event in her life, and then finally just admitting that despite all the make-up and smiles and pretending to be something, that she is in pain and her heart is breaking. There is a saying, and a song by Fergie, "big girls don't cry"... this is saying exactly the opposite, that it doesn't matter how old you are, if it hurts, you will feel it, and it is okay to cry. She's stuck in a perpetual loop of being expected to remain strong, look pretty, sit up straight, don't cry, and not being able to do it, seemingly resulting in a public breakdown because she has been hurt and by someone she loves/loved and she is lonely. Sia also wrote the song Pretty Hurts by Beyonce, and if you compare the lyrics to this song with that one, it's almost like they could be counterparts to the same story, most likely direct experiences from her life.
Lyrics: If you only once would let me; Only just one time; Then be happy with the consequence; With whatever's gonna happen tonight; ; Don't think we're not serious; When's it ever not?; The love we make is give and it's take; I'm game to play along; ; All I can say; I shouldn't say; ; Can we take a ride?; Get out of this place while we still have time; ; All the best DJs are saving; Their slowest song for last; When the dance is through, it's me and you; Come on, would it really be so bad?; ; The things we think might be the same; But I won't fight for more; It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve; Count on that for sure; ; All I can say; I shouldn't say; ; Can we take a ride?; Get out of this place while we still have time; You want to take a ride; Get out of this place while we still have time, yeah, we still have time; ; I can't say I was never wrong; But some blame rests on you; Work and play, they're never okay; To mix the way we do; ; All I can say; I shouldn't say; ; Can we take a ride?; Get out of this place while we still have time; You want to take a ride; Get out of this place while we still have time, yeah, we still have time
Sample outputs: I think this song is about two people who are in a relationship. They are in love, but they are not serious. They want to get out of the relationship and make it work. He doesn't want to fight for more. He wants to be happy with the consequence of whatever's gonna happen tonight. He is trying to convince himself that the relationship is going to work out, but he knows that it will never work out. He also wants to make the relationship work, and he wants to know if it will work out or not. He knows that he shouldn't say anything because he knows it's not going to happen, and that's what he wants it to be. He can't say that he was never wrong, but some blame rests on you. He's saying that he didn't know what was going on, but it's just not him to wear it on his sleeve, count on that for sure. He just wants to get back together with the person he loves, because he doesn't know if the relationship will work, or if it'll work out in the end.
Ground Truth: I guess I don't understand so many people looking for a hidden meaning in this song. Long time lurker, but I felt the need to make an account just to comment on this. To me it's as literal as you can get. It's about work place romance. It begins with him wanting to get with the office hottie. He's start convincing her that it'll be okay and not to worry about the consequneces. They go out one night, one things leads to the next (blame it on the slow song from the DJ) and they end up having sex. Then it gets weird and there's regret, and he says he's not taking all the blame for it. Or rather he already got the tail and is done with her or the other way around.

Lyrics: Do you think about; Everything you've been through; You never thought you'd be so depressed; Are you wondering; Is it life or death; Do you think that there's no one like you; ; We are; We are; We are; We are the ones; We get knocked down; We get back up and stand above the crowd; We are one; We are the ones; We get knocked down; We get back up and stand above the crowd; We are one; ; The life I think about; Is so much better than this; I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess; I'm sick of wondering; Is it life or death; I need to figure out who's behind me; ; We are; We are; We are; We are the ones; We get knocked down; We get back up and stand above the crowd; We are one; We are the ones; We get knocked down; We get back up and stand above the crowd; We are one; ; The life I think about; Is so much better than this; I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess; I'm sick of wondering; Is it life or death?; ; We are the ones; We get knocked down; We get back up and stand above the crowd; We are one; We are the ones; We get knocked down; We get back up and stand above the crowd; We are one; ; We stand above the crowd; We stand above the crowd; We stand above the crowd (Crowd); (We stand) We stand above the crowd; We stand above the crowd (We Stand); We stand above the crowd; ; (We are the ones) We stand above the crowd; (We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd; (We are the ones) We stand above the crowd; (We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd; ; We stand above the crowd; We stand above the crowd; We stand above the crowd
Sample outputs: I love this song. I think it's about being able to stand up for yourself, no matter what you're going through. It's one of those songs that makes you want to fight for what you believe in, and don't give up hope. I'm not sure if this song has anything to do with suicide, but it's a good song. It makes me think of a situation in my life that I'm in right now. I don't know if I'm the only one who's feeling this way, but this song makes me feel like I'm a better person than everyone else around me. I love the line "We are, we are, We are,We are the ones, We get knocked down, We Get back up and stand above the crowd." I think that's what the song is about. I also think it could be about someone who's going through a hard time in their life and doesn't know what to do about it, but he doesn't care. "The life I think about, Is so much better than this, I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess, I'm sick of wondering, Is it life or death, I need to figure out who's behind me." That's what I think of it.
Ground Truth: I just discovered this song; it's not that popular, but I wouldn't want it any other way. Considering what it's about, if you see what I mean. Yeah, if you've ever felt completely and utterly alone, you know what this song is about. I'm going through a difficult time right now, where I don't have any close friends at my school. It's one of the most painful things, to be suffering in isolation while you're surrounded by happy people in their cliques. So just knowing that you're not the only person that feels that way is all it takes to make your day a little easier. Plus, as the saying goes, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I think this song is trying to make a point, that because of your suffering, you become a better, tougher person. oobyllon September 04, 2007   
Lyrics: Words are flowing out; Like endless rain; Into a paper cup; They slither wildly; As they slip away; Across the universe; ; Pools of sorrow; Waves of joy; Are drifting through my opened mind; Possessing and caressing me; ; Jai Guru Deva, om; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; ; Images of broken light; Which dance before me; Like a million eyes; They call me on and on; Across the universe; ; Thoughts meander; Like a restless wind; Inside a letter box; They tumble blindly; As they make their way; Across the universe; ; Jai Guru Deva, om; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; ; Sounds of laughter; Shades of life; Are ringing through my opened ears; Inciting and inviting me; Limitless, undying love; Which shines around me; Like a million suns; It calls me on and on; Across the universe; ; Jai Guru Deva, om; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; ; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva
Sample outputs: This song is about the love of his life. He is in love with his life, but he is afraid of losing it. "Words are flowing outLike endless rainInto a paper cupThey slither wildlyAs they slip awayAcross the universePools of sorrowWaves of joyAre drifting through my opened mindPossessing and caressing me"He is afraid to let go of the love he has for his life and wants to be free of it. He wants to live in the moment and be free from the fear of the unknown. "PoolsOf sorrowWavs of joy are drifting throughMy opened mind PossessingAnd caressing"He wants to escape from the world and live free. "Jai Guru Deva OmNothing's gonna change my worldNothing's Gonna Change my world"He has no control over the world. " Images of broken lightWhich dance before meLike a million eyesThey call me on and on across the universe"He can't let go. "Thoughts meanderLike a restless windInside a letter boxThey tumble blindlyAs they make their wayAcross the Universe"He cannot let go, he is trapped in his own world. He can't escape the fear. "Stones of laughterShades of lifeAre ringing through my open earsInciting and inviting me Limitless undying loveWhich shines around meLike the million sunsIt calls me onAnd on Across the universe."He is in a state of bliss and he is free of the fear that the unknown will destroy him. "Tears of sorrow Waves of joy Are driftingThrough my open mind"He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't care. He just wants to enjoy life. "Colours of laughter Shades of life are ringing through your opened earsinciting and welcoming me"This is the most beautiful part of the song. It's so beautiful. It means so much to me. I'm not sure what it means, but it's a beautiful song. I love it.
Ground Truth: A rare out-take of John Lennon, that is recorded in his hotel's bathroom on a portable cassette, and over- dubbed, clean off by technicians, and put on the album. No, it is pure studio,and it always made my think of the girl I knew on the night I had her in some guys sofa, or I just kissed, I"m sure it was good. douglas159on June 18, 2017

Lyrics: Oh baby baby, oh baby baby; ; Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know; That something wasn't right here; Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go; And now you're out of sight; ; Show me how you want it to be; Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now because; ; My loneliness is killing me and I; I must confess I still believe, still believe; When I'm not with you I lose my mind; Give me a sign; Hit me baby one more time!; ; Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you; Boy you've got me blinded; Oh pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do; It's not the way I planned it; ; Show me how you want it to be; Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now because; ; My loneliness is killing me and I; I must confess I still believe, still believe; When I'm not with you I lose my mind; Give me a sign; Hit me baby one more time!; ; Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know?; Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go; ; I must confess that my loneliness; Is killing me now; Don't you know I still believe; That you will be here; And give me a sign; Hit me baby one more time!; ; My loneliness is killing me and I; I must confess I still believe, still believe; When I'm not with you I lose my mind; Give me a sign; Hit me baby one more time!; ; I must confess (my loneliness); That my loneliness (is killing me); Is killing me now (I must confess); Don't you know I still believe (still believe); That you will be here (I'm losing my mind); And give me a sign; Hit me baby one more time!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, and he's trying to get her back, but she doesn't want to be with him anymore, so he wants her back. He says "I must confess I still believe, that you will be here, and give me a sign, hit me baby one more time" but he also says "Don't you know, i still believe that you'll be here" which means that he still believes that she will be there, and that he'll be there for her, even if he's not with her. He's saying that even though he's with her, he still loves her, and she's still there for him. He knows that she's cheating on him, but he's telling her not to hurt him, because he knows it's not the way he planned it.
Ground Truth: This song is very self-explanatory. It's about Republicans. They are "hitting" the people, ie abusing them and screwing up their futures. The "baby" comes from the fact that Republicans think the normal people have the intelligence of babies. Pretty simple really. STFU_BSERSon May 29, 2004   
Lyrics: K, it's your ride; Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle; Pretend; Your garden grow, and it's your day to wed; ; We found your man; He's drinking up, he's all-American; And he'll drive; He's volunteered with grace to end your life; ; We'll tidy up; It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us; You explode; You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars; ; Feather oars; The world tilts back and pours and pours and so; You satellite; You tidal wave, you're a big surprise; ; And I've one more night; To be your mother; ; The signal interrupts; Baby's frequency not strong enough, remain; In my hands, and smile, we will miss you; But in time you'll get settled, and we will write; ; Hey, beauty supreme; Yeah, you were right about me; But can I get myself out from underneath; This guilt that will crush me?; ; And in the choir; I saw our sad messiah; He was bored and tired of my laments; Said, "I died for you one time, but never again"; ; Never again, never again, never again, never again; Never again, never again, never again, never again; ; Well, I love you so much (Never again); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again); No, 'cause I can dish it out (Never again); But I can't take it (Never again); ; Well, I love you so much (Never again); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again); 'Cause I can dish it out (Never again); But I can't take it (Never again); ; One will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Two will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Three will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Four will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Five will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Six will love you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; Seven loves you so much; But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; 'Cause I can dish it out; But I can't take it; ; (I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth); Seven loves you so much; (We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; (I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd); 'Cause I can dish it out; (I should be laughing right now); But I can't take it; ; (I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth); Seven loves you so much; (We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; (I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd); 'Cause I can dish it out; (I should be laughing right now); But I can't take it; ; (I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth); Seven loves you so much; (We'll never have to rot together underneath the dirt); But do me a favor, baby, don't reply; (I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd); 'Cause I can dish it out; (I should be laughing right now...); But I can't take it
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who was killed in a drunk driving accident. The driver of the limousine was drunk and hit her head on the side of the road. She was decapitated by a drunk driver and the limo driver hit her. The limo was a wreck and the driver was killed instantly. The mother of the girl was the flower girl and the flower boy was the one who killed her.
Ground Truth: this song is not about a break up, it is about a car wreck that happened...this is from amazon:The song is written about a tragedy that occured on July 4th, 2006. What started out as a beautiful wedding day for a young woman turned tragic when a drunk driver (Martin Heidgen) got into his pick up and proceeded to drive drunk down the wrong side of the road at 70 miles per hour. The drunken drive was cut short by his collision with the limousine carrying 6 people from the wedding to their homes. The crash killed the driver instantly and the flower girl from the wedding, Katie (7 years old) was decapitated by the twisted wreckage. The others were injured and the father was taken into intensive care. The saddest part of this story is this: Katie's mother woke up shortly after the wreck occured and proceeded to pull herself from the vehicle only to find the severed head of her daughter lying on the ground. She held onto her until the medical team picked them all up. clumsymoonon February 08, 2007   
Lyrics: Oh, well imagine; As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor; And I can't help but to hear; No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words; ; "What a beautiful wedding; What a beautiful wedding," says a bridesmaid to a waiter; And yes, but what a shame; What a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore; ; I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of; Closing a goddamn door?"; No, it's much better to face these kinds of things; ; With a sense of poise and rationality; I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of; Closing a goddamn door?"; No, it's much better to face these kinds of things; ; With a sense of...; ; Oh, well in fact; Well, I'll look at it this way; ; I mean technically our marriage is saved; Well this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne; Oh, well in fact; Well, I'll look at it this way; I mean technically our marriage is saved; ; Well this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne; Pour the champagne; ; I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of; ; Closing a goddamn door?"; No, it's much better to face these kinds of things; With a sense of poise and rationality; I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of; ; Closing a goddamn door?"; ; No, it's much better to face these kinds of things; With a sense of poise and rationality; Again...; I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of; Closing a goddamn door?"; No, it's much better to face these kinds of things; With a sense of poise and rationality; I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of; Closing a goddamn door?"; No, it's much better to face these kinds of things; With a sense of poise and rationality; Again...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a groom getting married to a girl who is a whore. He's pacing the pews in the church corridor and he can't help but to hear the bridesmaid and waiter exchanging words. The groom is telling the bride that he doesn't want her to be a whore and that he wants her to marry the groom. He says that it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality. I think the groom is trying to convince himself that the bride is not a whore, and that it is better to keep it to himself and not deal with the gossip. The bride is the bride and the waiter are the groom's friends. I don't think this is about the groom or the bride, I think it's more about the bride.
Ground Truth: Listen Dickhead. Aka Pandamoranda. I Know That Every Word Doesn't Need To Be Capitalized. Unfortunatly, My Cell Phone Doesn't, And Because Of This Every Word Gets Capitalized. Whether You Like It Or Not. Got It? Good. Thats What I Thought. Now Please Kindly Contract Hiv And Die Slowly. And To T-cap, My Favorite Off Of Out Of Exile Is Man Or Animal. And About This Song, I'm Beginning To Think That It's The Only Good One On The Whole Cd. unklueveron July 03, 2006   
Lyrics: Blake says no one ever really loved him; They just faked it to get money from the government; And Blake thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust; He shakes his head; And blinks his pretty eyes; But darling, trust me trust me; He's no Valentine; Though he said he would be mine; His heart is in Alaska all the time; ; Blake stays underwater for the most part; He collects loose change for all tomorrow's parties; And when Blake dates girl with tattoos of the pyramids; He breaks their hearts by saying it's not permanent; But in his velvet mind; He believes with all his might; We'll all go to Alaska when we die; ; Blake makes friend but only for a minute; He prefers the things he orders from the Internet; And Blake's been having trouble with his head again; He takes pills but never takes his medicine; He tells me that he's fine and the sad thing is he's right; And when it's two o'clock it feels like nine.; ; Blake says he is sorry he got through to me; If it's okay he'll call right back and talk to the machine; Blake says it looks acid rain today; He takes the fish inside he's very kind that way; But just like Caroline; He doesn't seem to mind; The globe is getting warmer all the time; ; It's still cold in Alaska; It's still cold in Alaska; It's still cold in Alaska
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy named Blake who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't really love him. She thinks he loves her, but he doesn't love her back. He thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust. He shakes his head and blinks his pretty eyes. But darling, trust me trust me. He's no Valentine. Though he said he would be mine. His heart is in Alaska all the time. Blake stays underwater for the most part. He collects loose change for all tomorrow's parties. And when Blake dates girl with tattoos of the pyramids. He breaks their hearts by saying it's not permanent. But in his velvet mind. He believes with all his might. We'll all go to Alaska when we die. Blake makes friend but only for a minute. He prefers the things he orders from the Internet. Blake's been having trouble with his head again. He takes pills but never takes his medicine. He tells me that he's fine and the sad thing is he's right. When it's two o'clock it feels like nine. Blake says he is sorry he got through to me. If it's okay he'll call right back and talk to the machine. He says it looks acid rain today, he takes the fish inside, he's very kind that way. But just like Caroline. He doesn't seem to mind. The globe is getting warmer. All the time, it's still cold in Alaska. It's still Cold In Alaska.
Ground Truth: Amanda said that this song is basically a "as many velvet underground references as i can fit into one song" song, but i think its about a guy who over doses on drugs or prefers drugs over people or some whoo hah of that sort. Yogurtoon November 19, 2008   
Lyrics: It starts with; One thing I don't know why; It doesn't even matter how hard you try; Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme; To explain in due time; ; All I know; Time is a valuable thing; Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings; Watch it count down to the end of the day; The clock ticks life away; ; It's so unreal; It's so unreal, didn't look out below; Watch the time go right out the window; Tryna hold on, did-didn't even know; I wasted it all just to watch you go; ; Watch you go; I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart; What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard; ; I tried so hard; And got so far; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; I had to fall; To lose it all; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; ; One thing, I don't know why; It doesn't even matter how hard you try; Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme; To remind myself how I tried so hard; ; I tried so hard; In spite of the way you were mockin' me; Acting like I was part of your property; Remembering all the times you fought with me; I'm surprised it got so far; ; Got so far; Things aren't the way they were before; You wouldn't even recognize me anymore; Not that you knew me back then; But it all comes back to me in the end; ; In the end; You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart; What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard; ; I tried so hard; And got so far; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; I had to fall; To lose it all; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; ; I've put my trust in you; Pushed as far as I can go; For all this; There's only one thing you should know; ; I've put my trust in you; Pushed as far as I can go; For all this; There's only one thing you should know; ; I tried so hard; And got so far; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; I had to fall; To lose it all; But in the end; It doesn't even matter
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who was in love with a girl, but she left him. He tried so hard to get her back, but in the end, it doesn't even matter. He tries to tell her that he loves her, but he doesn't know how hard she tries to get him back. So he tries to convince himself that he's not worth it, and that he'll get over it. He knows that it's not going to work out, and he knows that he can't let her go. He's trying to tell himself that it won't matter, that he won't hurt her anymore, because he'll never hurt her again. He wants her back and he wants her to know that even though he tried, it didn't work out. He doesn't want to hurt her, he wants to be with her, even though it's hard for him to get over her. He tells himself that everything will be okay, and she'll be with him forever, even if it's just for a short period of time. He loves her so much, and even though she leaves him, he still tries to make it work for her. This song is really good, and it's one of my favorites on the album. It's a great song, and one of the best I've heard in a long time. I can't wait for the new album.
Ground Truth: I JUST LOVE LINKIN PARK, OK? C'MON PEOPLE... A LITTLE APPRECIATION? I LOVE THIS SONG. GIVE 'EM SOME CREDIT LIKE IF Y'ALL CAN MAKE AN ALBUM TO SUCCEED! FIRST OF ALL, CAN YOU RECORD YOUR OWN SONG AND MAKE IT ON THE MARKET? angelfire9on April 25, 2003

Lyrics: - Lyrics and music by David Bowie; ; Hope little girl; Come blow me away; I don't care much; I win anyway; Just a dog; I'm Goddamn rich; An exploading mad; When I talk in the night; There's oil in my hands; What a dog; ; Fall Dog is cruel and smart; Smart time breaks the heart; Fall Dog bombs the moon; ; Devil in a market place; Devil in your bleeding face; Fall Dog bombs the moon; What a dog; ; There's always a moron; Someone to hate; A corporate tie; A wig and a date; Just a dog; ; These blackest of years; That have no sound; No shape, no depth; No underground; What a dog; ; Fall Dog is cruel and smart; Smart time breaks the heart; Fall Dog bombs the moon; ; A Devil in a market place; A Devil in your bleeding face; Fall Dog bombs the moon; What a dog
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who doesn't care about the world around him, and he just wants to be with the girl he loves. He wants her so bad, but he doesn't want to let her go. He just wants her to be happy with him, but at the same time, he wants to get away from the world. He doesn't really care about what other people think of him, he's just a dog. He's a dog, so he's not a bad person. It's a sad song, but it's a good one.
Ground Truth: on bowie.com he called bush an "poor shrunked ill prepared sourpuss." hee hee. i love how creatively he insults people. before this song never meant much to me because i didn't understand it and thought it was something weird about a dog, but thanks, guys, for adding meaning! hallospacegirlon September 06, 2006   
Lyrics: Hello; Is there anybody in there; Just nod if you can hear me; Is there anyone at home; Come on now; I hear you're feeling down; And I can ease your pain; Get you on your feet again; Relax; I'll need some information first; Just the basic facts; Can you show me where it hurts; ; There is no pain, you are receding; A distant ship smoke on the horizon; You are only coming through in waves; Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying; When I was a child I had a fever; My hands felt just like two balloons; Now I've got that feeling once again; I can't explain, you would not understand; This is not how I am; I have become comfortably numb; ; I have become comfortably numb; ; O.K.; Just a little pin prick; There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!; But you may feel a little sick; Now can you stand up?; I do believe it's working, good; That'll keep you going through the show; Come on it's time to go; ; There is no pain, you are receding; A distant ship smoke on the horizon; You are only coming through in waves; Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying; When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse; Out of the corner of my eye; I turned to look but it was gone; I cannot put my finger on it now; The child is grown, the dream is gone; And I have become comfortably numb
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who had a fever, and he had to get a pin prick to stop it from happening again. I don't know if it's true but I think it's about a girl who is going through a hard time in her life, and she doesn't know how to deal with it. She wants to be with him, but he doesn't want to help her. He wants to show her how much he loves her, but she won't tell him. He's trying to tell her that he's fine, and that he'll do whatever it takes to get her through the show. She doesn't understand why he's doing this, because he can't explain it to her. She's saying that she can't understand what he's going through, so he's not going to let her go. She just wants him to be happy, even though he knows it's not what he wants. He also wants her to show him how much she loves him, and if he's okay, he'll tell her how he feels about her. I think that's what this song means to me, because it's a great song, and I'm not trying to make it sound cheesy, but it's just what I think of when I listen to it. I love this song, it's one of my favorites, and it's so sad. It's so easy to relate to when you're in a situation like that, and you can't get out of it, because you're so messed up that you don't even know what you're doing.
Ground Truth: I downloaded a video of Floyd playing this song in Live 8. What the hell happened to Roger's voice? He sounds like he's 100 years old. He can barely make himself audible, and even then it's barely more than a whisper. RightWing4Stringon July 20, 2005   
Lyrics: How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment; How to defer to men in solve-able predicaments; How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you; How to have that not work and have them run away from you; ; How to keep people at arm's length and never get too close; How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most; How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone; How to feel worthless unless you're serving or helping someone; ; I'll teach you all this in eight easy steps; A course of a lifetime you'll never forget; I'll show you how to in eight easy steps; I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best; ; How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist; How to be all pious when you're really a hypocrite; How to hate god when you're a prayer and a spiritualist; How to sabotage your fantasies by fears of success; ; I'll teach you all this in eight easy steps; A course of a lifetime you'll never forget; I'll show you how to in eight easy steps; I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best; ; I've been doing research for years; I've been practicing my ass off; I've been training my whole life for this moment I swear to you; Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you; ; I'll teach you all this in eight easy steps; A course of a lifetime you'll never forget; I'll show you how to in eight easy steps; I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best; ; How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else; How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself; How to numb a la holic to avoid going within; How to stay stuck in blue by blaming them for everything; ; I'll teach you all this in eight easy steps; A course of a lifetime you'll never forget; I'll show you how to in eight easy steps; I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best; ; I'll teach you all this in eight easy steps; A course of a lifetime you'll never forget; I'll show you how to in eight easy steps; I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best.
Sample outputs: i think this song is about how we all have to learn to be who we want to be, and how we have to do everything in our power to make the world a better place. i think it's also about how you have to live your life to the fullest, and if you're not going to do it, you need to learn how to be yourself, and that's what this song means to me. i've been doing research for years, I've been practicing my ass off, I have been training my whole life for this moment, I swear to you, Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you, i'll teach you all this in eight easy steps, a course of a lifetime you'll never forget. i'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best. this is just my take on it. i love this song, it makes me think about my own life, and i'm so proud of myself for being who i am. it's just a great song, i love it so much. i can't wait for the new album to come out! i love the lyrics, i think this is one of the best songs ive heard in a long time. i'm not sure what the meaning is, but it's a good song, and it's pretty self-explanatory. i don't know if anyone else has heard it, but i just love it. this song makes me want to cry everytime i listen to it. it gives me goosebumps, it's so powerful. i wish i could listen to this song over and over again, it just makes me feel so good. and i just wish i had the opportunity to see them live. i hope i do. i have no idea what i'm talking about, but this song has so much meaning to me, and this is my favorite song on the album. it just gives me chills, and makes me smile. it really is a great album, i can relate to it, i'm a huge fan of their music, and the lyrics are just so powerful, and they're so powerful to me that it's hard to put into words what they're saying. i could be wrong, but that's just what i think. i LOVE this song. it reminds me of my ex-boyfriend, and he's so much better than me. he's a great person, but he's just so different from me, he's not the same as me. but i

Lyrics: I miss you, miss you; ; Hello there, the angel from my nightmare; The shadow in the background of the morgue; The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley; We can live like Jack and Sally if we want; ; Where you can always find me; And we'll have Halloween on Christmas; And in the night we'll wish this never ends; We'll wish this never ends; ; I miss you, miss you; I miss you, miss you; ; Where are you? And I'm so sorry; I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight; I need somebody and always, this sick, strange darkness; Comes creeping on so haunting everytime; ; And as I stared I counted; The webs from all the spiders; Catching things and eating their insides; Like indecision to call you; ; And hear your voice of treason; Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?; Stop this pain tonight; ; Don't waste your time on me; You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you); Don't waste your time on me; You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you); ; Don't waste your time on me; You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you); Don't waste your time on me; You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you); ; Don't waste your time on me; You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you); Don't waste your time on me; You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you); ; I miss you, miss you; I miss you, miss you; ; I miss you, miss you; I miss you, miss you
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl who he can't get out of his head. he misses her so much that he wants her to come back to him, but he cant because he knows she will always be there for him. he wants to be with her, even though he knows he will never be able to get her back. he's trying to tell her that he loves her, but she won't leave him, and he just wants her back, and that he doesn't want her to waste her time on him. "Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head"he's telling her to not waste his time on her, because he'll always be the voice in her head, and she'll always love him, even if he's gone. "I miss you, miss you"he misses her, and wants to go back to her. "don't waste my time on you" he's saying that he's not going to waste his life on her because he's already gone, and if she doesn't come back, he's going to be alone. "i'm so sorry, i can't sleep, i cannot dream tonight"he wants to say that he will always love her, no matter what happens. "this sick strange darknesscomes creeping on so haunting everytime"he can't stop thinking about her, so he's asking her if she'll ever come back. "and as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiderscatching things and eating their insidesLike indecision to call youAnd hear your voice of treasonWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?" he's hoping that she'll come back and stop the pain that he is going through. "stop this pain"he doesn't know if she will come back or not, because she's gone and he's just waiting for her to return. "please don't waste you time on my, you've already been gone, so don't worry about me, I'll be okay, I'm okay, you'll be ok, I've been gone for a long time, and I'll still be okay with you, and you'll still love me, even after you're gone." he's begging her to stay with him, to stay away from him, because if she does, he'll be gone forever. "we can live like Jack and Sally if we want"he knows that he'll miss her forever, but that's just my opinion
Ground Truth: well my interpretation goes like this, sorry if its a repeated meaning! I think that he's obviously broken up with this girl, but cant get her out of his head.. He has nightmares but she's always the angel in them, there to rescue him from the horror of it all... He's dreaming they can have an impossible relationship- live like jack and sally. The second verse, he's trying to sleep, but how can he when she's not there? He's talking about when you try to sleep, and its so dark its eerie-like... U look around your room and stare at cobwebs up in the ceiling while ur trying to sleep... Then he's trying to fall asleep, and u know when u really miss someone, its right before u fall asleep that u miss them the most... and he's contemplating calling her, but he doesnt want to hear her voice of betrayal... maybe he ended the relationship badly or something and doesnt want to hear the pain in her voice... And the chorus, well she doesnt need to do anything cos she's that voice in his head... he's always thinkin bout hererinajaneon May 21, 2005   
Lyrics: Keep the noise low; She doesn't wanna blow it; Shaking head to toe; While your left hand does the show me around; Quickens your heartbeat; It beats me straight into the ground; You don't recover from a night like this; A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless; A hand moves in the dark to a zipper; Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets; Barely whisper, this is so messed up; Upon arrival the guests had all stared; Dripping wet and clearly depressed; He'd headed straight for the stairs; No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch; Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships; He keeps his hands low; He doesn't wanna blow it; He's wet from head to toe and; His eyes give her the up and the down; His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up; But the body on the bed beckons forward; And he starts growing up; The fever, the focus; The reasons that I had to believe; You weren't too hard to sell; ; Die young and save yourself; The tickle, the taste of; It used to be the reason I breathed; But now it's choking me up; Die young and save yourself; She hits the lights; This doesn't seem quite fair; Despite everything he learned from his friends; He doesn't feel so prepared; She's breathing quiet and smooth; He's gasping for air; This is the first and last time, he says; She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his; He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides; He's holding back from telling her; Exactly what it really feels like; He is the lamb, she is the slaughter; She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her; Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect; He whispers that he loves her; But she's probably only looking for; So much more than he could ever give; A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship; He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides; He waits for it to end; And for the aching in his guts to subside; The fever, the focus; The reasons that I had to believe; You weren't too hard to sell; Die young and save yourself; The tickle, the taste of; It used to be the reason I breathed; But now it's choking me up; Die young and save yourself; Up the stairs: the station where; The act becomes the art of growing up; The fever, the focus.; The reasons that I had to believe; You weren't too hard to sell; Die young and save yourself; The tickle, the taste of; It used to be the reason I breathed; But now it's choking me up, die young and save yourself
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a boy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to have sex with him. So he tries to convince himself that it's not going to happen, but he can't help it. He's trying to tell her that he loves her, and she's probably only looking for. He knows that he's going to end up with this girl, and he wants her to leave him, but the girl doesn't know how to tell him. He tries to keep her away from him, and in the end, he ends up having sex with her. He just wants to be with her, because he doesn't care about her. But he knows that she's not ready for it, and that he just can't take it anymore. He wants to leave her, but it's too late for him.

Lyrics: Now I know; That I can't make you stay; But where's your heart?; But where's your heart?; But where's your; ; And I know; There's nothing I can say; To change that part; To change that part; To change; ; So many, bright lights that cast a shadow; But can I speak?; Well is it hard understanding, I'm incomplete?; A life that's so demanding; I get so weak; A love that's so demanding; I can't speak; ; I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone; Honey, if you stay; I'll be forgiven; Nothing you can say can stop me going home; ; Can you see my eyes are shining bright?; 'Cause I'm out here; On the other side; Of a jet black hotel mirror; And I'm so weak; Is it hard understanding, I'm incomplete?; A love that's so demanding; I get weak; ; I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone; Honey, if you stay; I'll be forgiven; Nothing you can say can stop me going home; ; I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone; Honey, if you stay; I'll be forgiven; Nothing you can say can stop me going home; ; These bright lights have always, blinded me; These bright lights have always, blinded me; I say; ; I see you lying next to me; With words I thought I'd never speak; Awake and unafraid; Asleep or dead; ; 'Cause I see you lying next to me; With words I thought I'd never speak; Awake and unafraid; Asleep or dead; ; 'Cause I see you lying next to me; With words I thought I'd never speak; Awake and unafraid; Asleep or dead; ; 'Cause I see you lying next to me; With words I thought I'd never speak; Awake and unafraid; Asleep or dead; ; I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone; Honey, if you stay; I'll be forgiven; Nothing you can say can stop me going home; ; I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone; Honey, if you stay; I'll be forgiven; Nothing you can say can stop me going home; ; I am not afraid to keep on living; I am not afraid to walk this world alone; Honey, if you stay; I'll be forgiven; Nothing you can say can stop me going home
Sample outputs: I think it's about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him, and he knows it's wrong, but he wants to stay with her. He's not afraid to keep on living, he's not scared to walk this world alone. He knows that if he stays with her, he'll be forgiven, but at the same time, he knows he's going to be alone.
Ground Truth: Now,I have never been a huge My Chemical Romance fan. I mean, I listened to their stuff every now and then, but I was not really all that into them. But this song, I am proud to say, is absolutly amazing. Gerard has really stepped into a new light, and suprised me. This song is just brilliant. The lyrics, the guitars, the vocals, the video. It is absolutly fantastic. For the first time in my life, I applaud you, Gerard Way. bleedthecoloursopenon January 10, 2007   
Lyrics: She walks the line into her deathbed rings.; I say she's all alone.; Begging for forgiveness,; I won't teach her to lie or make a plan; with that clairvoyant stare and grin.; God won't forgive me,; for this I know,; and tradgedy unfolds tonight.; So sever my skin apart.; Take this sadness and close your eyes love.; ; Hey, call the angels.; This razorblade was meant for me.; Hey, call the angels.; We'll mutilate insanity.; ; She cuts the vein although it's much to dull.; I say she's all alone.; Fighting for redemption,; I know a little pain, a little lust.; I lose myself at night; to feel the rush of tearing my skin apart.; Take this sadness and close your eyes love.; ; Hey, call the angels.; This razorblade was meant for me.; Hey, call the angels.; We'll mutilate insanity.; ; Go deeper, I feel it, I see your ghost appear.; Go deeper, I see it, I feel your ghost appear.; I will say goodbye tonight (We sleep forever).; Hold on, hold on tonight love. We sleep forever. Hold on, hold on tonight love. We; ; sleep forever. Hold on, hold on tonight love. Close your eyes.; Hey, call the angels.; This razorblade was meant for me.; Hey, call the angels.; We'll mutilate insanity.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has killed his girlfriend. He's trying to convince her to forgive him, but she doesn't want to. He wants her to kill herself, but he can't because he knows she will never forgive him. He doesn't know what to do, so he kills himself. "She walks the line into her deathbed ringsI say she's all aloneBegging for forgivenessI won't teach her to lie or make a planWith that clairvoyant stare and grinGod won't forgive meFor this I knowAnd tradgedy unfolds tonightSo sever my skin apartTake this sadness and close your eyes loveHey, call the angelsThis razorblade was meant for meHey, Call the angelsWe'll mutilate insanityShe cuts the vein, although it's much to dullI say, she's aloneFighting for redemption, I know a little pain, a little lustI lose myself at nightTo feel the rush of tearing my skin awayTake this sad and close you eyes love"I think he's talking about how he's been hurt before, and he knows he'll never be the same again. "Go deeper, I feel itI see your ghost appearGo deeper I see itI feel you ghost appearI will say goodbye tonightHold on, hold on tonight loveWe sleep forever"He's talking to her, telling her that he'll always be there for her, and that he will always love her, even if she's gone. "Hold onHold on tonight, love, we sleep forever." He's saying that he's gonna say goodbye to her when she's dead, because he's not going to let her go. "Close your eyes, wake up"He knows she's going to be dead, he just wants to be with her, but it's too late. "I will have to say goodnight tonight, we'll sleep foreverHold on hold onTonight love, love. We sleep forever". He's telling her to stay with him, and to not let him go, because she can't be with him anymore. He knows that she will be gone forever, and she'll have to deal with it, so she'll go to sleep forever.
Ground Truth: and yes this song is about self-mutilation or "cutting" yourself. it is almost always overlooked and people look down on people who do cut themselves. people i know do cut themselves ocassionally and people label them as "emo". but its so annoying that people overlook the fact that they have problems with themselves and are in pain. we should not make fun of these "emotional" people; we should be nice and try to befriend them. i looove this song with a passionjennRAWRx3on April 12, 2007   
Lyrics: Hello, hello, hello, hello; Is there anybody in there?; Just nod if you can hear me; Is there anybody home?; ; Come on now; I hear you're feeling down; Well, I can ease your pain; And get you on your feet again; Relax; I need some information first, first; Relax; Just the basic facts; Can you show me where it hurts?; ; There is no pain, you are receding; A distant ship floats on the horizon; You're only coming through in waves; Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying; When I was a child, I caught a fever; My hands felt like two balloons; Now I've got that feeling once again; I can't explain, you would not understand; This isn't how I am; I-I have become comfortably numb; ; Okay, okay; It's just a little pinprick; There'll be no more, ha-ha-ha; But you may feel a little sick; ; Can you stand up now?; I do believe it's working; Uh-huh, uh-huh; Gotta keep it going through the show; Come on, it's time to go; Gotta keep it going through the show; Come on, it's time to go; Gotta keep it going through the show; Come on, it's time to go; Gotta keep it going through the show; Come on, it's time to go; ; There is no pain, you are receding; A distant ship floats on the horizon; You're only coming through in waves; Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying; When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse; Out of the corner of my eye; I turned to look, but it was gone; I cannot put my finger on; The child has grown, the dream is gone; I-I have become comfortably numb; I-I have become comfortably numb; ; Uh-huh, uh-huh; Uh-huh, uh-huh; Uh-huh, uh-huh; Uh-huh, uh-huh; Uh-huh, uh-huh; Uh-huh, uh-huh; I-I have become comfortably numb
Sample outputs: This song is about the death of Syd Barrett. It's about how Syd Barrett was a child when he was very young, and how he didn't have the strength to do anything about it. He was so young that he couldn't understand what he was going through, and that's why he became comfortably numb.
Ground Truth: LISTEN I WILL CORRECT EVERYBODY'S GUESSING IN THE AFORMENTIONED----->---->--->-->-> THIS SONG IS MEANT TO BE TAKEN IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, HOWEVER IT BEST SOUNDS TO YOU, IS WHAT IT MEANS. EVERY CAN RELATE TO THIS SONG, (Except maybe like Bill Gates or something hehe)BeautifulSoundon March 26, 2003   
Lyrics: Nobody likes you; Everyone left you; They're all out without you; Having fun; ; Where have all the bastards gone?; The underbelly stacks up ten high; The dummy failed the crash test; Collecting unemployment checks; Like a flunkie along for a ride; ; Where have all the riots gone; As your city's model gets pulverized?; What's in love is now in debt; On your birth certificate; So strike the fucking match to light this fuse; ; The town bishop is an extortionist; And he don't even know that you exist; Standing still when it's do or die; You better run for your fucking life; ; It's not over till your underground; It's not over before it's too late; It's cities burnin'; It's not my burden; It's not over before it's too late; There's nothing left to analyze; ; Where will all the martyrs go; When the virus cures itself?; And where will we all go when it's too late?; ; And don't look back; You're not the Jesus of Suburbia; The St. Jimmy is a figment of; Your father's rage and your mother's love; Made me the idiot America; ; It's not over till your underground; It's not over before it's too late; It's cities burnin'; It's not my burden; It's not over before it's too late; ; Well, she said I can't take this place; I'm leaving it behind; Well, she said I can't take this town; I'm leaving you tonight
Sample outputs: I think that the line "St. Jimmy is a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love, made me the idiot America" is refering to the fact that the people in Suburbia are not the same as Jesus of Suburbias. It's a reference to the St. Jimmy that Jesus was in the bible. I don't think that's what the song is about, though. I think it's about the state of America after the Vietnam War, and how it's over before it's too late. The line "And don't look back, you're not the Jesus of suburbia" is referring to how the people who died were the ones who were responsible for the war, and that they are the ones that are responsible for it. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but that's how I see it.
Ground Truth: I think this song ties together almost everything. I think that jimmy and Jesus are the same person because all the letters in the cd jacket are addressed to "J" for jimmy or Jesus, and the song states that "st. jimmy is a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love" and "your not the Jesus of suburbia" this explains the "oh therapy can you please fill the void" in part 4 of Jesus of suburbia. his home life made him, "Jesus," lose his Identity so he when to therapy. and I think that in homecoming when jimmy dies its the death of the alter ego. that’s what is meant by "he blew his brains out into the bay in the state of mind in my own private suicide." So with the death of jimmy, the rebellious drug using city punk, Jesus goes to “filling out paperwork”whatsernameon December 26, 2004   
Lyrics: Saying "I love you"; Is not the words I want to hear from you; It's not that I want you; Not to say, but if you only knew how easy; It would be to show me how you feel; ; More than words; Is all you have to do to make it real; Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me; 'Cause I'd already know; ; What would you do if my heart was torn in two; More than words to show you feel; That your love for me is real; ; What would you say if I took those words away; Then you couldn't make things new; Just by saying "I love you"; ; More than words; ; Now but I've tried to talk to you; And make you understand; All you have to do is close your eyes; And just reach out your hands; And touch me; Hold me close, don't ever let me go; ; More than words; Is all I ever needed you to show; Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me; 'Cause I'd already know; ; What would you do if my heart was torn in two; More than words to show you feel; That your love for me is real; ; What would you say if I took those words away; When you couldn't make things new; Just by saying "I love you"; ; More than words; More than words; More than words; More than words; More than words
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, and she wants to tell him how much she loves him, but he doesn't know how to tell her. "What would you do if my heart was torn in twoMore than words to show you feelThat your love for me is real"He is trying to convince her that she is the one for him, and that he loves her, but she can't tell him. "Now but I've tried to talk to youAnd make you understandAll you have to do is close your eyesAnd just reach out your handAnd touch meHold me closeDon't ever let me go"He's trying to get her to open up to him, to show her how much he means to her, and he can't do it. "I love you"He wants her to know that he's not the only one for her, that he is for her. He's just trying to make her understand that he still loves her. I think this is a song about a relationship that has ended, and it's about a man who doesn't want to let her go, because he's afraid that she won't be able to let him go. "Saying I love youIs not the words I want to hear from youIt's not that I want youNot to say, but if you only knew how easyIt would be to show me how you feel"This is about how he's telling her how he feels, and how he wants to be with her, so he's saying "I want you, but I don't want you to know how I feel." "More than WordsIs all I ever needed you to showThen you wouldn't have to say that you love me'Cause I'd already know"He loves her so much that he wants her so badly, he's willing to do anything to make it work. He wants to show that she's the one, but it's not as easy as it seems. "When you couldn't make things newJust by saying, I Love you"This means that she doesn't need to explain how she feels to him anymore, because she's already been through it, and this is what he wants. "And what would you say if I took those words away? When you couldn’t make things
Ground Truth: It is a beautiful song. I think it means just using the words "I love you" won't make a relationship built on love. She has to prove that she is in love with him (not necessarily sexually). ButtercupPPGon March 30, 2003

Lyrics: It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in; It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel; And I didn't mind, it's not my kind; It's not my time, to wonder why; Everything gone white, everything's grey; Now you're here, now you're away; I don't want this, remember that; I'll never forget, where you're at; ; Don't let the days go by; Glycerine, glycerine; ; I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time; Are you at one, or do you lie; We live in a wheel, where everyone steals; But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields; If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face; Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste; ; Don't let the days go by; Could have been easier on you; I couldn't change though I wanted to; Should have been easier by three; Our old friend fear and you and me; Glycerine, glycerine; Don't let the days go by, glycerine; Don't let the days go by; Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah; ; Glycerine, glycerine; Oh, glycerine, glycerine; ; Bad moon whine again; Bad moon whine again; As she falls around me; ; I needed you more, we wanted us less; Could not kiss, just regress; It might just be me, simple, and plain; Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names; Don't let the days go by; Could've been easier on you you you; Glycerine, glycerine; Glycerine, glycerine
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a relationship that has gone wrong, and the singer is trying to fix it, but he doesn't want to. "It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in. It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel. And I didn't mind, it's not my kind." He doesn't know what to do with himself, he just wants to be with the person he loves, and he's trying to make it work. "Everything gone white, everything's grey. Now you're here, now you're away. I don't want this, remember that, I'll never forget, where you're at." He's thinking about what he could have done had he just changed. "Don't let the days go by, Glycerine. I couldn't change though I wanted to. Should've been easier by three. Our old friend fear and you and me." He knows he can't change, but it's hard to change. "I needed you more, we wanted us less. Could not kiss just regress. It might just be me, simple, and plain. Well, that's just fine, thats just one of my names." He wants to fix the relationship, but that doesn't work, so he needs to move on. "Bad moon whine again. Bad moon whips again. As she falls around me. I needed youmore. We wanted to be less, could not kiss, just regress." He needs to get over it, because he knows that he's not the one for her. He needs her more, and that's all he needs. He wants her to be happy, and be happy with him, and not give up on him, because she's a beautiful person. He's trying so hard to make things work, but she doesn't feel the same way as he does, and it's just not working out. I'm not sure if this is a stretch, but this is what I think it means to me.
Ground Truth: I like this song, but seriously. The song is called Glycerine, and pronounced "Glic-er-eene." Someone mentioned Nitroglycerin which is an explosive, but is used for CHEST PAIN. On another note, "glycerine" suppositories are used for constipation, so I have no idea what this song means, but I like it anyway. wb666on December 25, 2005   
Lyrics: Another day has gone; I'm still all alone; How could this be; You're not here with me; You never said goodbye; Someone tell me why; Did you have to go; And leave my world so cold; ; Every day I sit and ask myself; How did love slip away; Something whispers in my ear and says; That you are not alone; I am here with you; Though you're far away; I am here to stay; But you are not alone; I am here with you; Though we're far apart; You're always in my heart; But you are not alone; ; 'Lone, 'lone; Why, 'lone; ; Just the other night; I thought I heard you cry; Asking me to come; And hold you in my arms; I can hear your prayers; Your burdens I will bear; But first I need your hand; Then forever can begin; ; Every day I sit and ask myself; How did love slip away; Something whispers in my ear and says; ; That you are not alone; I am here with you; Though you're far away; I am here to stay; But you are not alone; I am here with you; Though we're far apart; You're always in my heart; But you are not alone; ; Whisper three words and I'll come running; And girl you know that I'll be there; I'll be there; ; That you are not alone; I am here with you; Though you're far away; I am here to stay; But you are not alone; I am here with you; Though we're far apart; You're always in my heart; But you are not alone; ; I am here with you; Though you're far away; I am here to stay; But you are not alone; I am here with you; Though we're far apart; You're always in my heart; But you are not alone; ; Not alone oh; You are not alone; You are not alone; Say it again; You are not alone; You are not alone; Not alone, not alone; If you just reach out for me girl; In the morning, in the evening; Not alone, not alone; You and me; Not alone; Oh together together; Gotta stop being alone; Gotta stop being alone
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy who is far away from her. He is trying to convince himself that he is not alone and that he can be with her no matter what. He wants her to know that he will always be there for her and he will never leave her.
Ground Truth: this probably sounds stupid, but for me this song is from or for my grandad. i miss him so much and when i hear this song it reminds me that although he isnt here wiht me anymore, hell always be looking iver me and taking care of me so im not alone. nolovenogloryon April 09, 2005   
Lyrics: Hey hey mama said the way you move; Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove; ; Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing; Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.; ; Hey hey baby when you walk that way; Watch your honey drip, can't keep away; ; Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, ah, ah; Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, ah, ah.; ; I gotta roll, can't stand still; Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill; ; Eyes that shine, burnin' red; Dreams of you all through my head; ; Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ahhh; ; Hey, baby, whoa baby, pretty baby; Darlin' makes 'em do me now; Hey, baby, oh baby, pretty baby; Move me like you're doin' now; ; Didn't take too long 'fore I found out; What people mean by down and out; ; Spent my money, took my car; Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star; ; I don't know, but I been told; A big-legged woman ain't got no soul; Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah; Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah; All I ask for when I pray; A steady rollin' woman won't come my way; Need a woman gonna hold my hand; Tell me no lies, make me a happy man; Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ahhh.; Ah, yeah!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a girl, but he can't have her because he doesn't want to be with her. He wants to have a woman who will make him happy and make him feel like he's not alone in the world. He doesn't know how to live without her, and he's trying to find a way to make her happy, but she won't come back to him.
Ground Truth: i don't mean this entire song, but i can see references to drugs in this song, more specifically marijuana;I gotta roll, can't stand still, got a flame in my heart, can't get my fill. Eyes that shine burning red, dreams of you all through my head. he has to roll joints and the like. a flame to light it up. he can't get enough of it. his eyes turn red; he gets stoned. Didn't take too long 'fore I found out, what people mean my down and out. Spent my money, took my car, started telling her friends she wants to be a star. he spends all his money and has to end up selling his car to pay for his habits. All I ask for when I pray, steady rollin' woman gonna come my way. Need a woman gonna hold my hand, won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man. he needs a woman to roll some joints? that would make him happy. i wouldn't trust my interpretation of some of the lyrics. i just saw some things that could be related in a way, but probably aren't. this song is probably about some chick. pink adamon January 10, 2005   
Lyrics: Been on top of the world since about six months ago; Marking the first time I laid eyes on you; I lost all train of thought as I entered the room; Saw what looked like really good food; Then I saw you and so did you; ; I wanna wake up naked next to you; Kissing the curve in your clavicle; Kissing your clavicle; ; Been on top of the world since about one week ago; Marking a time when I was drunk enough to talk to you; I lost all train of thought as your eyes met mine; Told you I thought you were gorgeous; You gave me your phone number, I gave you mine.; ; Before you left, I said that you can bet; I'll be bothering you soon; You said "No bother, please do"; ; I've called you twice; It's been a hellish fight; To not think about you all the time; Sitting around waiting for your call; ; I wanna wake up naked next to you; Kissing the curve in your clavicle; Kissing your clavicle; ; I wanna wake up naked next to you; Kissing the curve in your clavicle
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but doesn't know how to talk to her. He doesn't want to be with her, and he doesn't really care about her anymore. He wants to wake up naked next to her, but he can't because he's too busy thinking about her all the time. That's why he says "I've called you twice, it's been a hellish fight, to not think about you all the the time, sitting around waiting for your call." I think this is a great song, and I love the way he sings it. I think it's about a girl who is trying to get over a guy, and she doesn't care about him at all. It's a very beautiful song, I can't wait to hear the rest of the album.
Ground Truth: OMFG NickmanHWM that is the friggin 5th time I have read your ramblings about Alkaline Trio selling out...and by now no one fucking cares. First off do you even know what the meaning of selling out is?! No it's not appearing on MTV to make more money that's called making a living. Selling out is when you change your music style and how you sound to appeal to more fans, that's selling out, and last time I checked Alkaline Trio still rocks hardcore on the new CD Good Mourning and the old fans still love them as much as any new fans. Think about this...Blink 182, they sold out back when the CD Enema of the State was released. You can hear a blatant difference between the sound of it and Dude Ranch which was in my opinion one of their best CD's. But wait...didn't Blink 182 start going mainstream when Dude Ranch came out, yeah that's right it's because the needed money. They didn't want to stay an underground band and have no one know about them all their life. They sold out when Enema of the State appeared because the sound of the music changed and it appealed to more fans. In my opinion Good Mourning by Alk3 is a sweet album and competes to any of their other albums. So stop acting like your 'punk' and calling every band that appears on MTV a sellout. I really don't think Alkaline Trio has multiple jobs other then the band so obviously they need to make money off of it and as much money as they can....-_- just my two cents since no one else seems to want to defend Alk3 to his ramblings...I'm done...MechSpikeon June 27, 2003   
Lyrics: Jesus, don't cry; You can rely on me honey; You can combine anything you want; I'll be around. You were right about the stars; Each one is a setting sun; ; Tall building shake; Voices escape singing sad sad songs; Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks; Bitter melodies turning your orbit around; ; Don't cry. You can rely on me honey; You can come by any time you want; I'll be around; You were right about the stars; Each one is a setting sun; ; Tall buildings shake; Voices escape singing sad sad songs; Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks; Bitter melodies turning your orbit around; ; Voices whine. Skyscrapers are scraping together; Your voice is smoking; Last cigarettes are all you can get; Turning your orbit around; ; Our love. Our love; Our love is all we have; Our love. Our love is all of God's money; Everyone is a burning sun; ; Tall buildings shake; Voices escape singing sad sad songs; Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks; Bitter melodies turning your orbit around; ; Voices whine. Skyscrapers are scraping together; Your voice is smoking; Last cigarettes are all you can get; Turning your orbit around; Last cigarettes are all you can get; Turning your orbit around; Last cigarettes are all you can get; Turning your orbit around
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is in love with someone, but they don't know how to make it work, and they have no idea how to do anything about it. "You were right about the starsEach one is a setting sun"I think it's about a man who is trying to help a girl, but she doesn't want to help him, and he's telling her that he'll always be there for her. "Told to chords strung down your cheeksBitter melodies turning your orbit around"This part of the song seems to be talking about how he's trying to convince her that they can work together, and that he will be there when she needs him. "Your voice is smokingLast cigarettes are all you can getTurning your orbit round"He's saying that he won't give up on her, because he knows she's not going to change. "Our love is all we haveOur loveIs all of God's moneyEveryone is a burning sun"This is talking about the fact that he doesn't have anything to do with her, he's just trying to get her to think about him, to make her think that he's good enough for her, but that's just my two cents.
Ground Truth: I've read some great opinions of this song, but i tend to interpret it a bit differently. I look at it as being about music, and the emotional comforts/discomforts it brings us. "Tall buildings shakeVoices escape singing sad sad songsTuned to chords strung down your cheeksBitter melodies turning your orbit around"The shaking tall buildings are experiences some have had, then they proceed to write songs conveying the emotional distress and growth they have had as well. The second part of the stanza refers to the listener and the effect the songs have on him/her. ie, "turning your orbit around"and as for, "Our love is all we have"well i interpret this very literally. "Your voice is smokingLast cigarettes are all you can getTurning your orbit around"Anyone who has ever smoked knows that the last cigarrete in a pack is something to savor, and i think jeff is comparing this enjoyment to the thrill of experiencing penetrating song writing (that, once again, can "turn your orbit around"). Drugs also seem to be a feasible subject, considering the songwriter. xgohawkson August 18, 2008

Lyrics: Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy; Isn't it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore; Maybe it's me, but this line isn't going anywhere; Maybe if we looked hard enough, we could find a backdoor; Find yourself a backdoor; ; I see you in line, dragging your feet; You have my sympathy; The day you were born, you were born free; That is your privilege; ; Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me; Doesn't have a clue why he's waiting, or what he is waiting for; Maybe it's me, but I'm sick of wasting energy; Maybe if I look in my heart, I could find a backdoor; Find yourself a backdoor; ; I see you in line, dragging your feet; You have my sympathy; The day you were born, you were born free; That is your; That is your privilege; ; Find yourself a backdoor; ; I see you in line, dragging your feet; You have my sympathy; The day you were born, you were born free; That is your privilege; I see you in line, dragging your feet; You have my sympathy; The day you were born, you were born free; That is your; That is your privilege; That is your; That is your; That is your privilege
Sample outputs: I think that this song is about a person who is in a relationship with someone who is not in love with him or her. The person is trying to find a way out of the relationship, but the other person doesn't want to. "Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of meDoesn't have a clue why he's waitingOr what he is waiting forMaybe it's meBut I'm sick of wasting energyMaybe if I look in my heartI could find a backdoorFind yourself a backdoor"The person is saying that he doesn't know what he's doing, but he can't help it. "I see you in line dragging your feetYou have my sympathyThe day you were bornYou were born freeThat is your privilege"This is the person who has the right to be who he wants to be, and he's trying to convince himself that he's not doing it because he's in a bad relationship. "It's a privilege to be with someone, and that's your privilege." This is basically saying that the person is in line for the relationship to end, but they don't know how to get out of it.
Ground Truth: the world today is screwed up by society and rules and government and all that crap, and not too many people notice it because of corruption. this is a song about how easy it is to look from a different perspective, and maybe look for a way outtobymakon February 19, 2002   
Lyrics: You think you know me; Word on the street is that you do; You want my history; What others tell you won't be true; ; I walked a thousand miles while everyone was asleep; Nobody's really seen my million subtleties; ; Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt; Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh; Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark; If you want my auto, want my autobiography; Baby, just ask me; ; I hear you talking; Well, it's my turn now; I'm talking back; Look in my eyes; So you can see just where I'm at; ; I walked a thousand miles to find one river of peace; I walked a million more to find what this shit means; ; Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt; Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh; Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark; If you want my auto, want my autobiography; Baby, just ask me; ; I'm a bad ass girl in this messed up world; I'm a sexy girl in this crazy world; I'm a simple girl in a complex world; A nasty girl, you wanna get with me?; You wanna mess with me?; ; Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt; Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh; I laugh more than I cry; You piss me off, good-bye (Good-bye!); Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark; If you want my auto, want my autobiography; Baby, just ask me
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who has been in a relationship for a while, but she doesn't want to admit it. She wants to tell the guy that she knows him, and she wants him to tell her his history, but he won't be true. She's trying to convince him that she's not a bad person, and that she isn't. She doesn't know what to do with herself, but it's what she wants to do. She knows that it's going to be hard for her, but that's what it means to her. I'm a bad ass girl in this messed up worldI'm a sexy girlIn this crazy worldI’m a simple girl in a complex worldA nasty girl, you wanna get with me? You wanna mess with me. Got stains on my t-shirtAnd I'm the biggest flirtRight now I'm soloBut that will be changing eventuallyOhGot bruises on my heartAnd sometimes I get darkIf you want my auto, want my autobiographyBaby, just ask meI'm just a bad-ass girl, in this fucked up worldAnd I can't be sexy anymore, you piss me off, good-bye. I've got bruises in my heart and sometimes i get dark. I laugh more than I cryYou piss my offGood-bye, goodbye. I think this is a really good song, and I think it's about a guy who's in love with a girl, and he's telling her that he doesn't care about her anymore, because she's a good person. I love this song, it's one of the best in the world, and it's really catchy.
Ground Truth: This song is about gossip and what people think they know about you but in reality its really not who you are. She's saying that if you want to know something about her you should just ask her to her face. But KDub123 is right. The lyrics are submitted incorrectly. rebmikon October 10, 2004   
Lyrics: Sitting in a park in Paris France; Reading the news and it sure looks bad; They won't give peace a chance; That was just a dream some of us had; Still a lot of lands to see; But I wouldn't want to stay here; It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here; Oh but California; ; California I'm coming home; I'm going to see the folks I dig; I'll even kiss a Sunset pig; California I'm coming home; ; I met a redneck on a Grecian isle; Who did the goat dance very well; He gave me back my smile; But he kept my camera to sell; Oh the rogue the red red rogue; He cooked good omelettes and stews; And I might have stayed on with him there; But my heart cried out for you California; ; Oh California I'm coming home; Oh make me feel good rock 'n' roll band; I'm your biggest fan; California I'm coming home; ; Oh it gets so lonely; When you're walking; And the streets are full of strangers; All the news of home you read; Just gives you the blues; Just gives you the blues; So I bought me a ticket; I caught a plane to Spain; Went to a party down a red dirt road; There were lots of pretty people there; Reading Rolling Stone reading Vogue; They said "How long can you hang around?"; I said a week maybe two; Just until my skin turns brown; Then I'm going home to California; ; California I'm coming home; Oh will you take me as I am; Strung out on another man; California I'm coming home; ; Oh it gets so lonely; When you're walking; And the streets are full of strangers; All the news of home you read; More about the war; And the bloody changes; Oh will you take me as I am?; Will you take me as I am?; Will you?
Sample outputs: This song is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's so beautiful. I don't know what it's about, but I think it's pretty self-explanatory. I think the song is about a soldier returning home from war, and how he feels like he's going home to california, but he's not. He's going to see the folks he dig, and he'll even kiss a Sunset pig. That's my favorite part of the song.
Ground Truth: I was on a Navy ship off the coast of Vietman in 1972. When we finally got orders to return to the U.S., we would play this song over the P.A. speakers when we finished up with supplying another ship. duhaaston July 15, 2007   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: This place is set to break; It's just as safe from the outside tonight; ; And I want that; I face the storm's appetite; From the Lighthouse; ; And I want that; I embrace the storm and the night; Whole...; ; What do the waves have to say now?; What do the waves have to say now, now?; Slow now...; ; And let the waves have their way now, now; Slow...; And let the waves have their day; ; And I want that; ; Here I've been living unloosened from sin; Upward and Outward; " Begin, begin. "; ; Here I've been loosened, unliving within; Inwardly Urgent; I'm sinking again; ; The Lighthouse
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is in a relationship with someone else, but they can't stop thinking about each other. "What do the waves have to say now?" "I'm sinking again." "Here I've been living unloosened from sin. Upward and outward. Begin, begin." "And I want thatI've been loosened, unliving within. Inwardly urgent. I'm sinking, again." This is my favorite line of all time. I love this song. I think it's one of the best on the album.
Ground Truth: Perhaps one of the most brilliant songs ever made, the first time I heard it, I almost cried. For some reason it reminds me of my dad's funeral, perhaps cause he loved to sail and such...WooTrippy!on July 18, 2007   
Lyrics: Tuesday wakes up silent and there aren't enough pills to sleep (cut out); Like a miswired short wave radio; It's over but nothing can change to make this right (try again); When you live in a nightmare, its written all over your face; ; And in a short time; You're never the same again; The distance is streamlined; between decision and defence; ; Distorient the senses, loss of identity; No one to trust, no one to trust; ; Life runs through this trade; I am no killer, but I still hide my face, in the coming days; ; I wake up every morning from the same dream (kill it); But you can't change the letters when the ink dries; I woke up on the sidewalk and everything just changed (come on); And now the lights are blinking but I can't see anything; ; Life runs through this trade; I am no killer, but I still hide my face, in the coming days; Life runs through this trade; I am no killer; ; Everything's falling apart, Everything's falling apart; Everything's falling... apart; Crumpled paper, crushed tin cans, broken bottles; paper scraps, we're all the same, we're all the same, paper scraps; We're all the same, we're all the same; ; We all look the same; We all look the same; We all look the same; But I am the killer; ; And in a short time; Your never the same again; The distance is streamlined; Between decision and...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is in a bad relationship with someone and is trying to get over it, but they can't. "I am no killer, but I still hide my face, in the coming days." The person is telling the other person that they are not the same as they used to be, and that they don't have to hide their true selves anymore. "Everything's falling apart, everything is falling apart"The person is saying that he is the killer, because he is hiding his true self. "crumpled paper, crushed tin cans, broken bottles, paper scraps, we're all the same, we all look the same"They are saying that no matter how much they try to change, they are still the same person. "We all look different, but i am the killer." This person is not a killer, he is a killer. He is just a killer because he has to hide his real self. I think this is a really good song and one of my favorites on the album. I love it so much. I don't understand why people aren't able to relate to it.
Ground Truth: To me this song is about a relationship which has ended. "Tuesday wakes up silent" its silent implying hes alone.."And then it cuts out like miswired shortwave radioIt's over" - it hits him, the relationships over. His dream of how they were cuts out with the realisation of reality. "And in a short timeYou're never the same again" - it was only a short time ago he was happy and content.. and now he'll never be the same again. Hes lost his identity now ("Loss of identity") now they arent together. In "life runs through this trade" the trade is love.. he hides his face from the world in the coming days of after its over. He "wake(s) up every morning from the same dream" of them being together. But then he kills it, when he wakes up and realises hes killed his dream because it was his fault the relationship ended (But you can't change the letters when the ink dries)he "woke up on the sidewalk" the morning after the breakup, hes been drinking to cope with that happened.. "and everything just changed", as he realised its over. "Everything is falling apart:Crumpled paperCrushed tin cansBroken bottlesPaper scraps"The state of his apartment, hes too drained hopeless to do anything, things are just lying around everywhere - he sees no point in cleaning them up"We all look the sameWe all look the sameBut I am the killer" - Final closure, admitting he killed the relationship, its over cause of him. Killer is used to signify his guilt. Everyone looks the same, but really hes a killer that shouldnt be allowed out he feels. Anyway, thats what the song means to me :)tell me if you think its bollocksHypoon March 13, 2002

Lyrics: If I, I get to know your name; Well if I, could trace your private number, baby; ; All I know is that to me; You look like you're lots of fun; Open up your lovin' arms; I want some, want some; ; I set my sights on you; (And no one else will do); And I, I've got to have my way now, baby; ; All I know is that to me; You look like you're having fun; Open up your lovin' arms; Watch out here I come; ; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; ; I, I got to be your friend now, baby; And I would like to move in just a little bit closer (Just a little bit closer); ; All I know is that to me; You look like you're lots of fun; Open up your lovin' arms; Watch out, here I come; ; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; ; I want your love; I want your love; ; All I know is that to me; You look like you're lots of fun; Open up your lovin' arms; Watch out, here I come; ; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; ; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; ; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round; You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round; Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a woman who is also in love. He wants to be with her, but she doesn't want to know his name. She wants to know if he knows her name, and if he could trace her private number. He is saying that she looks like a lot of fun, and he wants her to know that he loves her. He also says that he wants to "watch out here I come" which means that she wants him to watch out for her. I think the line "I set my sights on you (and no one else will do) and I, I've got to have my way now, baby" means that he is looking for her to open up to him. He says that she is a very good person, and that he has to have his way now. He knows that she likes him, but he knows that he needs to get to know her before he can find her true love. The line "You spin me right round, baby, right round" means he is trying to get her to love him back. He has to be her friend, so he would like to move in just a little bit closer (just a little more closer). He wants her love to be his love. I'm not sure if this is right or not, but I think this is what the song means to me.
Ground Truth: Great song with such high energy. It's not about sex. It's about him WANTING her...probably for sex. OK, most definitely for sex:) Since he's just met her (actually he's just seen her), than the 'love' he wants is not overly deep. Well, you know what I mean:)rolypolywoofwoofon December 13, 2011   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Words are flowing out; Like endless rain; Into a paper cup; They slither wildly; As they slip away; Across the universe; ; Pools of sorrow; Waves of joy; Are drifting through my opened mind; Possessing and caressing me; ; Jai Guru Deva, om; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; ; Images of broken light; Which dance before me; Like a million eyes; They call me on and on; Across the universe; ; Thoughts meander; Like a restless wind; Inside a letter box; They tumble blindly; As they make their way; Across the universe; ; Jai Guru Deva, om; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; ; Sounds of laughter; Shades of life; Are ringing through my opened ears; Inciting and inviting me; Limitless, undying love; Which shines around me; Like a million suns; It calls me on and on; Across the universe; ; Jai Guru Deva, om; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; Nothing's gonna change my world; ; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva; Jai Guru Deva
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is so deeply in love with someone that they have no idea how to express their feelings. The person is so in love that they don't know what to do. The line "nothing's gonna change my world" is a reference to the line "jai guru deva om" which means that nothing is going to change his world. The song is saying that no matter what happens, he will always be there for them. It is a beautiful song, and one of the best on the album.
Ground Truth: i don`t remember the source from where i got this info and don`t know if it completely correct but i heardthe john and yoko had either a fight or were just talking and she said something and he couldn`t get it out ofhis head so he wrote it down. i think im wrong :(thespacemanliveson October 14, 2009   
Lyrics: Could you turn up the; track a little bit, please; My mouth fell open; ; Hoping that the truth; Would not be true; Refuse the news; I'm feeling sick now; ; What the fuck am I; Supposed to do; Just lose and lose; First time I saw you; ; You were sitting; Backstage in a dress; A perfect mess; You never knew this; ; But I wanted badly for you to; Requite my love; Left on the floor; ; Leaving your body; When highs are the lows; And lows are the way; So hard to stay; Guess now you know; I love you so; I liked your whiskers; And I liked the; ; Dimple in your chin; Your pale blue eyes; You painted pictures; Cause the one; ; Who hurts; Can give so much; You gave me such; Left on the floor; Leaving your body; When highs are the lows; And lows are the way; So hard to stay; Guess now you know; I love you so
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who loves a girl, but she doesn't love him back. He wants her to requite his love, left on the floor. He knows he loves her, but he knows it's not going to work out. He doesn't want her to know that he's in love with her, and he knows that it's going to be hard for her to get over him. I think it's about a girl who is a bitch to him, and the guy doesn't know how to deal with it. He's trying to get her to let him know that she loves him back, but it's too hard. He loves her so much that he can't stop thinking about her. He thinks that she's beautiful, and she's a beautiful person, but then he realizes that she'll never know. I don't know, that's just what I think. I'm not sure if this is right or not, but I think that's what it means to me. I love this song, and it's one of my favorites on the album.
Ground Truth: its about kurt cobain it says so in anthoneys book 'scare tissue'. He was in hawiie with his girlfriend and they got a call saying kurt cobain had died and then spent the whole day crying not because anthoney new him that well but because it was a loss to the musical world. hes also reflecting saying well if a great man like him died like this and he was heavily on drugs then whats going to become of me?

Lyrics: She's beautiful in her simple little way; She don't have too much to say when she gets mad; She understands, she don't let go of anything; Even when the pain gets really bad; I guess I should've been more like that; ; You had it all for a pretty little while; And somehow you made me smile when I was sad; You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart; And then you realized you wanted what you had; I guess I should've been more like that; ; I should have held on to my pride; I should have never let you lie; I guess you got what you deserve; I guess I should've been more like her; ; Forgiving you, well, she's stronger than I am; You don't look much like a man from where I'm at; It's plain to see, desperation showed its truth; You love her as she loves you with all she has; I guess I should've been more like that; ; I should have held on to my pride; I should have never let you lie; I guess you got what you deserve; I guess I should've been more like her; ; She's beautiful in her simple little way
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who was in love with a girl, but she didn't love him back, and he's trying to convince himself that he should have been more like her. I think the "you" is the girl, not the guy. He's saying that he shouldn't have let her lie, because he knows that she's stronger than him, but he's telling her that she doesn't deserve him, and that she deserves better. It's a beautiful song, and I love it.
Ground Truth: I've read a lot of the comment here, and I have to agree with those who say that the song is written from the point of view of the "other woman" singing about a man who cheated but ultimately decided to stay with his girlfriend. The lines "She don't let go of anything, Even when the pain gets really bad," makes me think that the girlfriend never "let go" of the man, that they were not broken up. The line "You had it all for a pretty little while," also indicates that he was probably seeing both women at the same time, and "I should have never let you lie," indicates to me that the other woman knew that the man was still with his girlfriend, she knew that he was lying, both to the girlfriend by seeing someone behind her back and probably to the other woman by telling her that he would eventually leave his girlfriend. However, I can see how the argument could be made that the man and his girlfriend were either broken up or on a break because of the the line "Then you realized you wanted what you had," since "had" is in the past tense, but that entire part of the song is in the past tense, so it wouldn't have made sense to say "Then you realized you wanted what you have." I still have a great deal of respect for Miranda Lambert as a strong woman and an artist, but I think that if this song was autobiographical, she was someone's "other woman" for a time. However, most artists take a great deal of liberty when they create, so it's possible that she was only in a similar situation to the woman in the song, not an identical situation.

Lyrics: Recently I've been; Hopelessly reachin; Out for this girl; Who's out of this world; Believe me; ; She's got a boyfriend; He drives her round the bend; Cause he's 23; He's in the marines; He'd kill me; ; For so many nights now; I find myself thinkin about her now ohhh; ; Cause obviously she's out of my league; But how can I win; She keeps draggin me in; And I know I; Never will be good enough for her; No no; I never will be good enough for her; ; Gotta escape now; Get on a plane now; Yeah; Off to LA; And that's where i'll stay; For two years; ; Put her behind me; (Put her behind me); And go to a place where she can't find me ohhh; ; Cause obviously she's out of my league; I'm wastin my time; Cause she'll never be mine; And I know I; never will be good enough for her; No no; I never will be good enough for her; ; She's out of my hands; And I never know where I stand; Cause I'm not good enough for her; Good enough for her x6; ; Cause obviously she's out of my league; I'm wastin my time; Cause she'll never be mine; And I know I; never will be good enough for her; ; Cause obviously she's out of my league; But how can I win; She keeps draggin me in; And I know I; never will be good enough for her; ; Cause obviously she's out of my league; I'm wastin my time; Cause she'll ne-ver be mine; And I know I; never will be good enough for her; No no; I never will be good enough for her
Sample outputs: I love this song. It's one of my favorites off the new album. I think it's about a guy who's in love with this girl, but she's not happy with him. He's in the marines. He'd kill me, for so many nights now, I find myself thinkin about her now, ohhh, cause obviously she's out of my league, but how can I win, she keeps dragging me in, and I know I, never will be good enough for her, no no, I'll never be good for her. Gotta escape now, get on a plane now, yeah, off to LA, and that's where I'll stay for two years, put her behind me, and go to a place where she can't find me, ohhhh, because obviously shes outta my league. I'm wastin my time, cause she'll never ever be mine, and i know i, never won't be goodenough for her...no no, i'll never, never, ever, be good, for her x6. That's what I think. It reminds me of my ex boyfriend, who is in the military. I know he's out there, but I just don't want to be with him anymore. I don't know what to do with myself, because I'm not good enough, and he won't give me a chance. I just want to get out of here, and get away from him, and move on. This is my favorite song off of the new CD. I love it. I can't wait for it to come out on the other side of the world. I wish I could listen to it, but it's just too much for me to handle. This song is so beautiful. It makes me want to cry every time I hear it, because it reminds me so much of him. I miss him so much, and it just makes me feel like I'm the only person in this world who cares about him, but he doesn't care, because he's the only one who cares for me. I hope it's good for him.
Ground Truth: They have alot of talent? And what is it that makes them talented? Their lyrical abilities, their musicianship, or the way they can make 14 year old girls wet their pants? Sorry, but I can't really see the talent there, it mus be really well hidden, but good for you if you can. Mute_Airon March 28, 2005   Link1 Reply

Lyrics: Song About An Angel; So I say; Still away; Sleep close my eyes; An image of; Your face; Traced in white sand; Underneath; Undefined; I lay down; With arms outstreched; I embrace the fall; And all the time; I tried; To let you know; Discomfort comes clearly; Woh; Sometimes you see right through me; Words, words; Your married to that; Your married to that; Your married to your pain; Although you hit me hard; I come back; The earth cries; And I call; On the inside; Running behind; Which one will I face?; Running behind; Which one will I...; Thin comfort; In what I say; My back is turned; I halo my soul; For awhile; And all the time; I tried; To let you know; Discomfort; Comes clearly; When I shout; Woh; Sometimes you see right through me; Words, words; Your married to that; Your married to that; Your married to your pain; Although you hit me hard; I come back; The earth cries; And I fall; On the inside; Running behind; Which one will I face?; Running behind; Which one will I...
Sample outputs: To me this song is about someone who is in love with a person who is not there for them, but they are always there to comfort them when they are hurt. "Sometimes you see right through meWords, words, your married to thatYour married to your painAlthough you hit me hardI come backThe earth criesAnd I callOn the insideRunning behindWhich one will I face? Running behindWhich One will I... Thin comfortIn what I sayMy back is turnedI halo my soulFor awhileAnd all the time I triedTo let you knowDiscomfort comes clearlyWhen I shout"This part is so powerful. It's like when you're in love, and you don't know what to say or do. You just want to be with the person you love, but you can't because you're afraid of being hurt. I think this is a song about a person trying to reach out to the person they love, because they don't understand what they're trying to say, and they're afraid they're going to hurt them, or they won't be able to do anything about it.
Ground Truth: i have the CD, the lyrics are the same up there as in the printed lyrics that come with the CD. this is one of my favorite songs. its so beautiful and haunting. my favorite part is when he screams "although you hit me hard i come back". its so awesome. liddy001on July 02, 2003   
Lyrics: I feel it everyday it's all the same; It brings me down but I'm the one to blame; I've tried everything to get away; So here I go again; Chasing you down again; Why do I do this?; ; Over and over, over and over; I fall for you; Over and over, over and over; I try not to; ; It feels like everyday stays the same; It's dragging me down and I can't pull away; So here I go again; Chasing you down again; Why do I do this?; ; Over and over, over and over; I fall for you; Over and over, over and over; I try not to; Over and over, over and over; You make me fall for you; Over and over, over and over; You don't even try; ; So many thoughts that I can't get out of my head; I try to live without you, every time I do I feel dead; I know what's best for me; But I want you instead; I'll keep on wasting all my time; ; Over and over, over and over; I fall for you; Over and over, over and over; I try not to; Over and over, over and over; You make me fall for you; Over and over, over and over; You don't even try to
Sample outputs: I love this song. It's about being in love with someone that you can't get out of your head. You can't do anything about it, and you just want to be with them, but you just can't. "I know what's best for me, but I want you instead, I'll keep on wasting all my time." It's one of the best songs on the new album, and it's definitely one of my favorites. I love the lyrics, and the music video as well. I think it's about a guy who loves a girl, but he can't be with her because he's afraid of being hurt by her. He knows that she's not the one for him, and he knows that he's hurting her, but it's hard to let go of her. "You make me fall for you, over and over"I love that line. It makes me think of a guy that's in a relationship with a girl and he's trying to convince himself that he doesn't love her, and that's why he's "chasing her down again". It's a beautiful song, and I love it. I can't wait to see them in concert next month.
Ground Truth: This song is not a love song about a person it is about the drug oxycontin which Adam Gontier (the singer) was heavily addicted to before writing this album. He wrote a lot of the One-X album while in rehab, and a large share of the songs on that album are about being an drug addict i.e. "The Animal I Have Become", "Pain", etc. The song is about how he falls in love over and over with the feeling of being high on oxy's. The lyrics talk about how he is feeling down and out then he gets high and he falls in love once again with the drug. And the process keeps repeating. He says he feels dead when he tries to leave "her" aka oxycontin and that he knows it is the wrong thing to do, but that he'd rather waste his time getting high than being sober and doing the right thing. As someone who was also heavily addicted to oxycontin I know in my heart that this song is about it, everything he says is how all opiate addicts feel. We fall in love over and over with opiates everyday, and that is what the song is about! Thankfully Adam has been sober since writing this album 6 years ago, so there is a happy ending to this song in real life! punker1984on March 13, 2012   
Lyrics: Set adrift on memory bliss of you; baby you send me baby you send set adrift on memory bliss of you; The camera pans the cocktail glass behind a blind of plastic plants; I found the lady with the fat diamond ring; ; then you know I can't remember a damn thing; I think it's one of those deja-vu things; or a dream that's trying to tell me something; or will I ever stop thinking about it; ; I don't know I doubt it suberranean by design; I wonder what I would find if I met you let my eyes caress you; until I meet the thought of Missess Princess who; often wonder what makes her work; ; I guess I'll leave that question to the experts; assuming that there are some out there they're probably alone solitaire; I can remember when I caught up with a pasttime intimate friend; she said: Bet you're probably gonna say I look loveley; ; but you probably don't think nothing of me; she was right though I can't lie she' just one of those corners in my mind; and I just put her right back with the rest that's the way it goes I guess; Baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; ; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; The careless whisper from a careless man a neutron dance for a neutron fan; marionette strings are dangerous things I thought of all the trouble they bring; an eye for an eye a spy for a spy rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh; ; tell me that she's not dreaming she's got an ace in the hole; it doesn't have meaning reality used to be a friend of mine; ; 'cause complete control I don't take too kind; Christina Applegate you gotta put me on; guess who's piece of the cake is Jack on; she broke her whispers in my heart were fine; ; what die she think she could do I feel for her I really do; the next day I had the ring finger on her hand; I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan; but I had to put her right back with the rest that's the way it goes I guess; Baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; ; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; Baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; Baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you; baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me baby you send me; baby you send me baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but he can't get her out of his head. He keeps thinking about her, and he wants to be with her, but it doesn't work out. He wants her to be a big PM Dawn fan, but she doesn't feel the same way about him. He's trying to convince himself that he doesn't need her, that he's just going to have to have sex with her. He doesn't want to be the "big PM Dawn Fan" because he knows it's wrong. He just wants to get her to feel the way he feels about her. "Baby you send me baby you sent me set adrift on memory bliss of you." He's telling himself that she's not dreaming about him, and that he'll never be able to have her. It's a beautiful song, and I love it.
Ground Truth: Like someone mentioned, there's a lot of nostalgia in the lyrics. One question, if anyone knows. I'm pretty sure "a neutron dance for a neutron fan" is in reference to The Pointer Sisters. Is "A careless whisper from a careless man" a reference to "Careless Whisper" by George Michael? It makes sense, but not sure how any of this fits together. mgoodwin16on April 10, 2011   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it; I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted; I fell right through the cracks; Now I'm trying to get back; ; Before the cool-done run out, I'll be givin' it my best-est; And nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention; I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some; ; But I won't hesitate no more, no more; It cannot wait, I'm Yours; ; Well, open up your mind and see like me; Open up your plans and, damn, you're free; And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love; ; Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing; We're just one big family; And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved; ; So I won't hesitate no more, no more; It cannot wait, I'm sure; There's no need to complicate, our time is short; This is our fate, I'm Yours; ; Doo ch doo doo doo joo; Ba doo ja doo ja doo doo ba; Do you want to come on a scooch on over closer, dear?; And I will nibble your ear; A soon da ba ba boom ba baum; Whoa, whoa, ahuh, hmm; ; I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror; And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer; But my breath fogged up the glass; And so I drew a new face and I laughed; ; I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason; To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons; It's what we aim to do; Our name is our virtue; ; But I won't hesitate no more, no more; It cannot wait, I'm Yours; Well, open up your mind and see like me; Open up your plans and, damn, you're free; Look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours; So please don't, please don't, please don't; There's no need to complicate; 'Cause our time is short; This, oh, this, oh, this is our fate; I'm Yours; ; Bbdrra ba dum ta ba pudum dem; T-du, du, t-du, du, t-du, du, du, du, du-du-du; Hmm, mm, oh I'm Yours!; Oh I'm Yours!; Woah, woah, baby do believe I'm Yours; You best believe, you best believe I'm Yours, mmhm!
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a girl who wants to be herself, but she can't because she is afraid of being herself. "i tried to be chill, but you're so hot that i melted" she's trying to be someone she can be herself and not be afraid to be who she is. "before the cool-done run out i'll be giving it my bestest and nothing's gonna stop me but divine interventioni reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some" she wants to change herself so that she can become who she used to be, and she's not afraid of herself, she's willing to learn from her mistakes. "but i won't hesitate no more, no more it cannot wait, i'm yours" she doesn't want to be afraid of becoming someone else. "well open up your mind and see like meOpen up your plans and damn you're freeAnd look into your heart and you'll find love, love love love" i think she's saying that she's going to do whatever it takes to make herself happy, and that no matter what she does, she will find love and happiness. "you best believe you best believe i'm yours" i love this part. it makes me think of how she's telling people to open their eyes and see that they are not afraid to change themselves, because they can be who they want. "I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirrorAnd bending over backwards just to try to see it clearerBut my breath fogged up the glassAnd so i drew a new face and i laughed"i think that means that she has been checking her tounge in a mirror and trying to figure out who they are, and what they want to do, and then she realizes that she is not going to be like everyone else, and they are going to have to be themselves. "im yours!" i think this part is saying that the only way to change yourself is to be yourself and not worry about what others think of you, and to do what others want you to do. i think that's what the song means to me.
Ground Truth: there were 2 parts of the song that i didnt get right away..but now i believe i was able to resolve it with this understandingchecking tongue/bending backwardhe is checking his tongue in the mirror but in order to see further in your mouth (back of your tongue) you have to bend your head backwards further so its ridiculous b/c the more you bend your head back you won't be able to see your face. the only success he has is to make the mirror foggy.. i think when he says bending over backwards it throws ppl off because we think he is bending from his waist. however the use bending over backwards does signify the great lengths we go through to prove ourselves and the truth is no matter how long you look at yourself in the mirror your true self is who you are "your name is your virtue"i was troubled by the word godforsaken means "wretched"..however if you break it up into 2 words...God forsaken..well its forsaken means "left up to us" ...God has left it up to us to love love love its a choice to love each other..we can hold back and let fear keep us from forming relationships. so don't wait on cupid..step out there and love...open up your heart and you will find it. nycrainbowon June 03, 2009   
Lyrics: Waiting for the winds of change; To sweep the clouds away; Waiting for the rainbow's end; To cast its gold your way; Countless ways, you pass the days; ; Waiting for someone to call; And turn your world around; Looking for an answer; To the question you have found; Looking for an open door; ; Whoa, you don't get something for nothing; You can't have freedom for free; You won't get wise; With the sleep still in your eyes; No matter what your dream might be; ; No, you don't get something for nothing; You can't have freedom for free; You won't get wise; With the sleep still in your eyes; No matter what your dream might be; ; What you own is your own kingdom; What you do is your own glory; What you love is your own power; What you live is your own story; ; In your head is the answer; Let it guide you along; Let your heart be the anchor; And the beat of your song; ; Oh, you don't get something for nothing; You can't have freedom for free, no; Whoa, you don't get something for nothing; You can't have freedom for free, no
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how we all have our own destiny, and no matter how hard we try, no matter what we do, we can't have freedom for free. It's a great song, and one of my favorites from the new album. I think it's about finding your own path in life, and having your own meaning for your life.
Ground Truth: I must add that I like the wordplay in this song. From wind and clouds to rainbow and (pot of) gold. From call to answer to answer of questions. From sleep to dreams. The words kingdom, power, glory, and story all fit well together. And yes, I can read into it an Ayn Rand influence and Objectivism, but I prefer the simpler and more direct take - don't sit around and wait for the world to come to you and solve your problems, go out and solve your own problems. Don't wait for someone to give you what you think you deserve, rather go out and earn it (what you want) or take it (opportunities). It is certainly a message that I need to hear from time to time, that I think we can all use being reminded of. nutshell02on October 06, 2014

Lyrics: Ticking away the moments; That make up a dull day; Fritter and waste the hours; In an off-hand way; ; Kicking around on a piece of ground; In your home town; Waiting for someone or something; To show you the way; ; Tired of lying in the sunshine; Staying home to watch the rain; You are young and life is long; And there is time to kill today; ; And then the one day you find; Ten years have got behind you; No one told you when to run; You missed the starting gun; ; (Solo); ; And you run and you run; To catch up with the sun; But it's sinking; ; Racing around; To come up behind you again; ; The sun is the same; In a relative way; But you're older; ; Shorter of breath; And one day closer to death; ; Every year is getting shorter; Never seem to find the time; ; Plans that either come to naught; Or half a page of scribbled lines; ; Hanging on in quiet desperation; Is the English way; ; The time is gone; The song is over; Thought I'd something more to say; ; Home; Home again; I like to be here; When I can; ; When I come home; Cold and tired; It's good to warm my bones; Beside the fire; ; Far away; Across the field; Tolling on the iron bell; Calls the faithful to their knees; To hear the softly spoken magic spell...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how we waste time, and how we should just enjoy the moment and enjoy the life we have, and not waste our time worrying about what tomorrow will be like. I think this is one of my favorite songs of all time.
Ground Truth: When your 40 and you look back at your life and see what you could have been, you get a song like TIME. The first portion of the song (the first 9 lines) are about how he, or us, or whomever the song is about wasted childhood away, didnt take initiative to follow ones dreams and failed to make something of ones self until "ten years had got behind you". The lines " no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun" perfectly describe the feeling of a failed opportunity at life. "And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun,but its sinking" The midlife crisis hits. Upon the realization that you've wasted your entire life you try to make up, to "catch up with the sun" and force a respectable existence out of the relatively short amount of years you have left. "Plans that either come to nought, or half a page of scribbled lines" The short burst of energy that is the midlife crisis has failed to procure any meaningful gains in ones life and you return to the normalcy of "hanging on in quite desperation". At this age "the time is gone, the song is over", you had your chance and you failed. There is nothing left to do but wallow in your depression and waste what time you have left at home, "warming my bones beside the fire"Time has slipped away from your control and now controls you. You wait for death while"Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells " The faithful are all the other people who let themselves be controlled by time, and they are in their graves (i.e. across the field, in the cemetery by the church)This song is about the midlife crisis that many of us will go through when we hit old age, and how futile it is to attempt to reverse time. If any form of advice could be etched from this song it would be to make something of yourself while you still can, while your young. TheWildabeaston July 24, 2011   Link2 Replies

Sample outputs: I love this song, it's so catchy and I love the fact that Green Day are so much more popular than Green Day. It's a good song to listen to if you don't like Green Day, and I think it's a great song to sing along to when you're down and out. I think Green Day is the best band in the world, and Green Day will never be as popular as Green Day was when they first came out. green_day_babyon March 22, 2005   
Ground Truth: Green Day came out with a pretty solid album with American Idiot. I like this song, it's not revolutionary, no shit, but it's a nice song anyways...fucking rednecks running this country. Turbine Revolutionon November 27, 2004   
Lyrics: I know what I know; I know on the car ride down; I hear it in my head real low; Turn into the only thing I ever; ; Turn into hope I do; Turn into you; ; I know what I know; Well I know that girl you found; Keep that kind of window closed; She'll turn into the only thing that ever; ; Turn into hope I do; Turn into you; ; Can't say why I kept this from you; My those quiet eyes become you; Leave it where it can't remind us; Turn this all around behind us, oh; Well I know; Well I'll fall right in to keep you out; I'd like to tell you all about it; ; I know what I know; I know it's the last time round; I'll hear it in my head real low; Turn into the only thing that ever knows; Only thing that ever knows; ; I know what I know; I know, ah yes
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been in love with a girl for a long time, but she doesn't want to be with him anymore. She's telling him that she'll do anything to keep him from leaving her, and that she wants him to "turn into the only thing that ever" because that's what he wants her to be. She knows that she can't stay with him forever, and she knows that he can't be with her forever, so she "will fall right in to keep her out" and "I'd like to tell you all about it" because she knows she'll never be able to forget him. She loves him so much that she's willing to do anything for him.
Ground Truth: i love this song! to me it means that she loves someone so much she wants to be like them, even if that isn't a good thing. "turn into, hope i do, turn into you." but her voice is so amazing on this song. pandora_ash_avalieon May 27, 2007   
Lyrics: Precious and fragile things; Need special handling; My God what have we done to you?; ; We always tried to share; The tenderest of care; Now look what we have put you through; ; Things get damaged; Things get broken; I thought we'd manage, but words left unspoken; Left us so brittle; There was so little left to give; ; Angels with silver wings; Shouldn't know suffering; I wish I could take the pain for you; ; If God has a master plan; That only He understands; I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through; ; Things get damaged, things get broken; I thought we'd manage, but words left unspoken; Left us so brittle; There was so little left to give; ; I pray you learn to trust; Have faith in both of us; And keep room in your hearts for two; Things get damaged, things get broken; I thought we'd manage, but words left unspoken; Left us so brittle; There was so little left to give
Sample outputs: I think this song is about the loss of a loved one. "Precious and fragile thingsNeed special handlingMy God, what have we done to you? We always tried to shareThe tenderest of careNow look what we have put you through"I think that this is talking about a relationship that is very fragile and fragile and that the person is trying to protect their loved one, but they have put them through so much pain and suffering that they have to take care of them. "Things get damagedThings get brokenI thought we'd manageBut words left unspokenLeft us so brittleThere was so little left to give"This is saying that even though the loved one has been through a lot, they can't take the pain anymore. "Angels with silver wingsShouldn't know sufferingI wish I could takeThe pain for youIf God has a master planThat only He understandsI hope it's your eyes He's seeing through"This means that the loved ones are still trying to help each other, but the love is slowly fading away. "I pray you learn to trustHave faith in both of usAnd keep room in your hearts for two"This part of the song means that they are trying to keep faith in each other. They don't want to give up on the relationship, but in the end, they know that they need to "keep room in their hearts" for two people. They know that their love will always be there for them, and that they will always have room for each other in their heart. "If god has a Master planThat Only He UnderstandI hope It's your Eyes He's Seeing Through"I believe this means that this person is going through a hard time, and they are hoping that God will help them through it. They want to know if there is a God that can save them, or if God will save them from their pain. This part means that if they have faith in God, they will be able to forgive each other for the pain they have caused each other and move on. This is just my two cents on the song.
Ground Truth: It's a known fact that even the wikipedia entry for Mart reports: the song is about the divorce and the effect on their children. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…There's also an external link that points to an EPK in the official site, that presumably contains reference to this fact. andreworgon May 24, 2006   
Lyrics: He's a real Nowhere Man; Sitting in his nowhere land; Making all his nowhere plans for nobody; ; Doesn't have a point of view; Knows not where he's going to; ; Isn't he a bit like you and me?; ; Nowhere Man, Please listen; You don't know what you're missing; Nowhere Man; The world is at your command; He's as blind as he can be; Just sees what he wants to see; Nowhere Man, Can you see me at all?; Nowhere Man, Don't worry; Take your time, Don't hurry; Leave it all; Till somebody else lends you a hand; Doesn't have a point of view; Knows not where he's going to; Isn't he a bit like you and me?; Nowhere Man, Please listen; You don't know what you're missing; Nowhere Man; The world is at your command; He's a real Nowhere Man; Sitting in his nowhere land; Making all his nowhere plans for nobody; Making all his nowhere plans for nobody; Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is a nowhere man, and he doesn't have a point of view. He doesn't know what he's going to do, but he knows that he can't get anywhere. He's a real Nowhere Man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody. He has no point in life, and doesn't want to do anything about it. He is a "nowhere man" because he's not who he wants to be. He wants to live in his own world, but it's not what he wants. Nowhere man, don't worry, take your time, Don't hurry, Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand. He just wants to enjoy life and not wait for someone else to give him a hand, because he knows he'll never get anywhere in life. He knows he won't be where he's gonna be in the long run, and that he'll have to wait for somebody else to lend a hand to him. But he's a "Nowhere Man", so he's saying don't wait until someone else lends a hand because he'll always be there for you, and don't waste your time waiting for someone to come along and help you out. This is a great song, and I love it. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard. I can't wait for the new album.
Ground Truth: this song is partially about everyone, and how unimportant most people are,another great guitar solo by George, he played in standard tune even though the other guitar has a capo on the 2nd fretBillie_Joeon June 30, 2003   Link1 Reply

Lyrics: Who's gonna tell you when; It's too late?; Who's gonna tell you things; Aren't so great?; ; You can't go on, thinkin'; Nothing's wrong, buh bye; Who's gonna drive you home; Tonight?; ; Who's gonna pick you up; When you fall?; Who's gonna hang it up; When you call?; ; Who's gonna pay attention; To your dreams?; Yeah who's gonna plug their ears; When you scream?; ; You can't go on, thinkin'; Nothing's wrong, buh bye; Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?; ; (Bye, bye, bye); (Bye, bye, bye); (Bye, bye, bye); (Bye, bye, bye); ; Who's gonna hold you down; When you shake?; Who's gonna come around; When you break?; ; You can't go on, thinkin'; Nothin's wrong, buh bye; Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?; Oh, you know you can't go on, thinkin'; Nothin's wrong; Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is depressed. He is in love with this girl, but she doesn't love him back, and he doesn't want to be with her. He wants to help her, but he can't. He loves her too much to be there for her, and it's hard for him to love her back. He doesn't know what to do with himself. He's trying to make her feel better, but it's too late. She can't go on thinking nothing's wrong, buh bye, who's going to drive her home tonight? (Bye, bye, bye)Who's gonna hold you down when you shake? Who's gonna come around when you break? (You can't stop thinking, no matter how much he loves her, she won't stop loving him. He'll be there when she needs him, he'll help her.)
Ground Truth: MemoryI've always had a hard time with this song, especially the line "You can't go on thinking nothing's wrong..."Whatever the reason, the man is saying that something serious happened. Since Ben Orr passed away, the song has a meaning to me outside of the video version. I had several relatives pass away around the same time, two of them with cancer. My relatives would tell me that everything would be okay, but I knew it wouldn't. Working in the medical profession, I see way too much sadness. Just reading this thread is enough to bring me to tears. lyricismon June 02, 2011   
Lyrics: He hit me; And it felt like a kiss.; He hit me; But it didn't hurt me.; ; He couldn't stand to hear me say; That I'd been with someone new,; And when I told him I had been untrue; ; He hit me; And it felt like a kiss.; He hit me; And I knew he loved me.; ; If he didn't care for me; I could have never made him mad; But he hit me,; And I was glad.; ; (instrumental break); ; Yes, he hit me; And it felt like a kiss.; He hit me; And I knew I loved him.; And then he took me in his arms; With all the tenderness there is,; And when he kissed me,; He made me his.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who has been cheated on by a guy and is trying to convince herself that he loves her. She is telling herself that she is not the only one, and that she loves him, but that she doesn't want to hurt him. I don't think this is a love song. I think it's about a guy who cheated on a girl, and she didn't want him to hurt her, but she knew that he loved her.
Ground Truth: This song was written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King after they discovered that a singer called Little Eva was regularly beaten by her boyfriend. They asked why she took it and she replied that his attacks showed that he loved her. It's an amazing song, but so very haunting.
Lyrics: Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans; Way back up with the woods among the Evergreens; There Stood an old cabin made of earth and wood; Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode; But never ever learned to read or write so well,; but he could play a guitar just like ringing bell; ; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; ; He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack; Go seat beneath the trees by the railroadtrack; All engineers sitting in the shade; stumming with the rhytm that the drivers made; The people passing by, they stopped and said,; "Oh my, but how that country boy can play"; ; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Johhnny B Goode! Go Johnny!; ; His mother told him someday you will be a man; And you will be the leader of a big old band; Many people coming from a miles around; To hear you play your music till the sun goes down; Maybe someday you name will be in lights,; saying Johnny B Goode To night; ; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Johnny B Goode; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Johnny B Goode; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Johnny B Goode; Go go! Go Johnny Go Go Go! Go Johnny Go!; Johnny B Goode
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy named Johnny B Goode who was born in Louisiana, and lived in a cabin in the Evergreens. He grew up in a small town and his parents told him that he would be a musician someday, and he was going to be the leader of a big old band. I don't know if this is right or not, but that's what I think of when I hear this song.
Ground Truth: Amazing! Why am I the first person to comment on their version of Johnny B. Goode!! This is probably the best cover of this song ever! With all due respect to Chuck Berry...Rob sings this song on a vocal scream that is so smooth and clear that it sounds like he's just whistling. And K.K. & Glen just have their guitars roaring. And the back up vocals are just great, you can even hear Rob given full voice.
Lyrics: Hey girl you know you drive me crazy; One look puts the rhythm in my hand; Still I'll never understand why you hang around; I see what's goin' down; Cover up with make up in the mirror; Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again; You cry alone and then he swears he loves you; ; Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?; Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?; Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end; As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found; A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect; ; Every action in this world will bear a consequence; If you wade around forever you will surely drown; I see what's going down; I see the way you go and say you're right again; Say you're right again, heed my lecture; Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?; Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?; Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end; ; As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found; Face down in the dirt she said: This doesn't hurt; She said: I finally had enough; Face down in the dirt she said: This doesn't hurt; She said: I finally had enough; ; One day she will tell you that she has had enough; It's coming round again; Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?; Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?; ; Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end; As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found; Do you feel like a man, when you push her around?; Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?; Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end; As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found; Face down in the dirt she says: This doesn't hurt; She says: I finally had enough
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl, and he is trying to help her, but she just keeps pushing him away. He tries to tell her that he loves her but she doesn't believe him. He's telling her that she's not the only one in the relationship, and that he's going to be there for her when she needs him, so he'll tell her how he feels.
Ground Truth: such a great song, heard it on the radio, loved it. saw the video on fuse today, loved it even more. its really good, not to mention the boys are prettty hottt. anyways, its self explanitory. FallOutBoyGirl4Lifeon June 28, 2006   
Lyrics: "They're... They're these terrors; And it feels as if somebody was gripping my; They're these terrors. And it's like; It feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat; Like last night; They're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors; They're... They're these terrors; Like last night, they are not like tremors; They are worse than tremors; They are these terrors; And it's like, it feels like as if somebody; Was gripping my throat and squeezing and...; As if like somebody was gripping my throat"; ; Some say, now suffer all the children; And walk away a savior; Or a madman and polluted; From gutter institutions; Don't you breathe for me; Undeserving of your sympathy; 'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did; ; And through it all, how could you cry for me?; 'Cause I don't feel bad about it; So shut your eyes; Kiss me, goodbye; And sleep; Just sleep; ; The hardest part; Is letting go of your dreams; ; A drink; For the horror that I'm in; For the good guys, and the bad guys; For the monsters that I've been; Three cheers for tyranny; Unapologetic apathy; 'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again; ; And through it all, how could you cry for me?; 'Cause I don't feel bad about it; So shut your eyes; Kiss me, goodbye; And sleep; Just sleep; ; The hardest part's; The awful things that I've seen; ; "Sometimes I see flames; And sometimes I see people that I love dying and; It's always..."; ; Just sleep; Just sleep; Just sleep; Just sleep; Just sleep; Just sleep; Wake up!; ; "And I can't... I can't ever wake up."
Sample outputs: This song is about being in a mental institution. The terrors are the nightmares that you go through when you're in a hospital. "They're these terrorsAnd it feels as if somebody was gripping my throatAnd it's like it feels like as somebody was gripped my throatLike last nightThey're not like tremors, they're worse than tremorsThey'reThese terrors like last night, they are notLike tremors they are worse then tremors"They're like, they feel like someone is gripping your throat and squeezing your throat. "Some say, now suffer all the childrenAnd walk away a saviorOr a madman and pollutedFrom gutter institutionsDon't you breathe for meUndeserving of your sympathyCause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I didAnd through it all, how could you cry for meCause I don't feel bad about itSo shut your eyes, kiss me goodbyeAnd sleepJust sleepThe hardest part'sThe awful things that I've seenSometimes I see flamesAnd sometimes I see people that I love dying andIt's alwaysJust sleep, just sleepAnd I can't...I can't ever wake up"I think this part is about feeling like you're going to die, and you can't go back to sleep. It's like you have no idea what you're doing and you don't know what to do, you just want to go to sleep, and just sleep. I love this song, it's one of my favorite on the album.
Ground Truth: this whole album is basically about death. It puts me in a gloomy mood when i hear the black parade. this song is moving just like the rest of their songs. I actually think it's the best one. myspace.com/… that's my website devoted to gerard mostly lol. This song is on my page. btw, when someone keeps rewinded it in the beginning to "I keep getting these terrors" or whatever is that Gerard saying that or someone else? what is he talking about? loop-to-loopon May 29, 2007

Lyrics: Say hey!; ; Hear the sound of the falling rain; Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey); The shame, the ones who died without a name; ; Hear the dogs howling out of key; To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey); And bleed, the company lost the war today; ; I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies; This is the dawning of the rest of our lives; On holiday; ; Hear the drum pounding out of time; Another protester has crossed the line (Hey); To find the money's on the other side; ; Can I get another amen? (Amen); There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey); A gag, a plastic bag on a monument; ; I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies; This is the dawning of the rest of our lives; On holiday; ; Hey; ; Three, four; ; The representative from California has the floor; "Sieg Heil" to the president Gasman; Bombs away is your punishment; Pulverize the Eiffel towers; Who criticize your government; ; "Bang, bang" goes the broken glass and; Kill all the fags that don't agree; Try to fight fire, setting fire; Is not a way that's meant for me; ; Just cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey...); Just cause, because we're outlaws, yeah; ; I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies; This is the dawning of the rest of our lives; I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies; This is the dawning of the rest of our lives; ; This is our lives on holiday
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how the american government is just a bunch of bunch of "hollow lies" that they put out to try to make the world a better place. I think the line "The representative from California has the floor,Sieg Heil to the president gasmanBombs away is your punishmentPulverize the Eiffel towersWho criticize your government" is saying that the americans are doing their best to get rid of all the people who criticize their government. "Bang bang goes the broken glass andKill all the fags that don't agreeTry to fight fire, setting fireIs not a way that's meant for meJust causeJust cause, because we're outlaws yeah"is saying that they don't want to be part of the world anymore, and that they're not going to do anything about it. "Just Cause, just cause, Just Cause, Because We're Outgunned, Yeah"I think that's saying that this isn't going to happen to us anymore, just because we are outgunned. I don't think it's going to make us a better world, but it's still a hell of a lot better than it used to be. I'm not saying that it's not a good thing, but I think that that's what it means to me, and I think it makes more sense if you think about it that way. That's just what I think. I love this song, and it's one of my favorites on the album. It's just so good. I can't wait for the new album to come out.

Lyrics: Don't be so hard on yourself; The name of the game is humiliation,; And thanks for your admiration.; I never thought I'd say this:; The way that we play has its confrontation,; And guilt by association.; ; Hold me, hold me, if I were to; I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you; It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can; So you, you can do what you have to; ; Hold me, hold me, if I were to; I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you; It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can; So you, you can do what you have to; ; Don't think too hard about it,; You never thought I'd get this far,; Would get this far without you.; Relax, stand back and watch it happen.; I'll wave my goodbyes into the night and say; ; Hold me, hold me, if I were to; I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you; It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can; So you, you can do what you have to; ; Hold me, hold me, if I were to; I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you; It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can; So you, you can do what you have to; ; Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.; Say you'll never let me go.; Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.; Say you'll never tell a soul.; ; Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.; Say you'll never let me go.; Say you'll never, ever. Say you'll never, ever.; Say you'll never tell a soul.; ; Hold me, hold me, if I were to; I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you; It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can; So you, you can do what you have to; ; Hold me, hold me, if I were to; I can't, can't, I swear I can't let you; It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can; So you, you can do what you have to
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she can't be with him because she doesn't want to hurt him. She wants him to hold her, but he won't let her go. I think the song is basically about two people who are in love, but they can't make it work. The guy wants to be with the girl but he can't because he's afraid of getting hurt again. The girl is telling him to "hold me if I were to, I can't, can't I swear I cant let you." The guy is telling the girl that he'll do whatever he can to make things work, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make the relationship work. It's all in your hands, so I'll do what I can, so you, you can do what you have to. I love this song. It just makes me want to cry everytime I listen to it. I just love the way it's sung and the way the lyrics are sung.
Ground Truth: jacklyn07im pretty sure its "and thanks for your admiration"i could be wrong though=]but this songis beast, i love it, love themand nights-like-this, i would KILL to see Jack's Mannequin and The Audition live TOGETHER=]great song great bandokay, bye! jordan_24on February 07, 2008   
Lyrics: Please excuse me but I've got to ask; Are you only being nice; Because you want something; My fairytale arab princess; Be careful how you respond; Cause you might end up in this song; I never gave you an encouragement; And it's doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; ; The more you try to erase me; The more, the more; The more that I appear; Oh, the more, the more; The more you try the eraser; The more, the more; The more that you appear; ; You know the answer; So why do you ask?; I am only being nice; Because I want someone, something; You're like a kitten with a ball of wool; And it is doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; ; The more you try to erase me; The more, the more; The more that I appear; Oh, the more, the more; The more I try to erase you; The more, the more; The more that you appear; ; No you're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in a relationship with a guy, but the guy is not really in love with her, and he tries to erase her from his mind, but she doesn't want to erase him from her mind. The more you try to erase me, the more the moreThe more that I appear. I think it's about how the guy wants to be with the girl, but he can't because he knows that the girl will end up in the same situation. It's like a kitten with a ball of yarn. It could be about how he just wants to get away from the relationship, but it's too much for him.
Ground Truth: Sorry. Didn't mean to put words in your mouth on what you think. I didn't know what you thought so I used the relationship example as a counter-example. Unfortunately, I have these 3 page long interpretations of just about every Radiohead/Thom Yorke song that I write, and what I post here is usually an abstract of that. I'm tired of posting abstracts and not being able to explain myself, which is causing confusion. I could see how my first post doesn't seem connected to my second post because those are just two pieces of my full interpretation. I was going to do the same for Skip Divided, which I also have a 3-page political interpretation, but I don't think it's worth the hassle to try to condense it. This website annoys me. I want to write a book on my religion based off of Radiohead lyrics, not "add a comment." I'm done here. foamweaponson September 19, 2006   
Lyrics: Now the party's over; I'm so tired; Then I see you coming; Out of nowhere; Much communication; In a motion; Without conversation; Or a notion; ; Avalon; ; When the samba takes you; Out of nowhere; And the background's fading; Out of focus; Yes, the picture's changing; Every moment; And your destination; You don't know it; ; Avalon; ; (Dancing, dancing); (Dancing, dancing); ; When you bossa nova; There's no holding; Would you have me dancing; Out of nowhere; ; Avalon; Avalon; Avalon; Avalon; Avalon; Avalon; Avalon...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who falls in love with a girl, but she doesn't know it. He's so in love that he doesn't care if she's with him or not. He wants to be with her, but he can't because he knows it's not going to happen, and he knows that if it does, he'll never get her back.
Ground Truth: To understand the meaning of the song, one should first determine the meaning of the allusions within the lyrics. Avalon is known to most as the mythical kingdom of King Arthur, but it has also had other meanings throughout history, as a mythical island paradise located in, variously: Old England, Italy, Sicily, Atlantis, etc. It has been described by several traditions as a place where apples grow, and where everything grows abundantly without effort, without the need for ploughing, planting, or weeding. It is, therefore, a kind of Garden of Eden or paradise on earth. Bossa Nova refers to a genre of Brazilian jazz music (with various other influences). The Bossa Nova took its name from the term "bossa" which refers to something artistically new, which flows from a talented artist in a seemingly effortless way. Originally "bossa" referred to free-flowing, effortless talent; later the term was adopted to describe the bossa nova music style as "the new thing." "When you're bossa nova...." The song is describing the feeling of satisfaction of being "at the top of your game," and the satisfied, yet excited emotion experienced when everything is working right. Comparisons are made between the talent that springs effortlessly through the fingers of a talented musician or artist and the pleasant harmony of congenial friendship (at the party), and the effortless (even unspoken) communication between lovers. When everything is working right, there is understanding without having to "work at it." And when everything is working right, it is truly "Avalon." I agree that the music greatly enhances the meaning of the lyrics. The female vocals at the end of the song are particularly beautiful and awe-inspiring. They too seem effortless, like the voices of angels. monalison September 09, 2010   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Another night slips away.; In other words I should say; there are no words he should say.; There are no words.; ; In his eyes I see the fear; that only time can disappear.; If only time could reappear.; Now's the time.; ; Something to take it away.; To take it away. To take it.; ; Don't let it stay.; Don't let it stay.

Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who is going through a rough time in his life. He is trying to get over it, but he can't. He wants to get away from it. He's trying to convince himself that he's beautiful, and that he doesn't have to worry about it anymore. He just wants to move on.
Ground Truth: I see two (very different) possible meanings in In Other Words... The first is an outsider (or possibly a person telling saying these words to their past self) reflecting on a breakup with a beautiful woman. The first portion deals with the the confusion and pain that comes from losing someone after a breakup. In the confusion of that time, "there are no words" that will console you. The subject reimagines the good times, and longs for them, and fears that they will never fee that way again. They seek "something to take it [the pain and those fears] away"... but only time will do so. The song then pivots to the understanding that the subject will in time realize... that the beautiful woman he loved left him not because he wasn't enough, but because of her own insecurities. It's only able to get over her by realizing that he too had been wrapped up in the superficial, and is only having as much trouble moving on because her beauty makes it had to not see her as an object... one that he very much wants to hold on to. He eventually moves on (with bold refrain)... with some peace, and conviction, knowing that no matter how much he wants to keep her, he cannot force her to be with him... she is after all a butterfly. And she too has moved on ("his old campaign" to win her over and keep her, "is moving on"). There were likely a lot of reasons that their love didn't stay... but he realizes that she wasn't happy because she doesn't know how to be happy (she "put[s] her problems on the shelf", rather than dealing with them). The realest thing about her is her delusion that she will find happiness in someone other than herself. In the end, "what can't stay goes away"... and he realizes that. And the pain "starts stopping when it starts stopping"... in time. The other possible interpretation is that the song is about Samsara (or the illusory nature of reality)... "[days and] night[s] slip away" wondering if there is more to life... and what our purpose is. But there is no explanation (that words can be used to explain any o

Lyrics: She knew she was able to fly; Because when she came down; She had dust on her hands from the sky; She said I touched a cloud; She felt so high; The dust made her cry; She knew she could fly like a bird; But when she said; 'Please raise the roof higher' nobody heard; They never noticed a word; The light bulbs burn; Her fingertips will learn; Why should it feel like a crime?; If I want to be; With you all the time; Why is it measured in hours?; You should make your own time; You're welcome in mine; She knew she was able to fly; Because when she came down; She had dust from her hands on the sky; She said I touched a cloud; Her fingers will learn; The lightbulbs burn
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy who is trying to make her happy, but she doesn't want to be with him. She's trying to convince him that she's okay, but he doesn't believe it. The line "Why should it feel like a crime?" I think it's about the end of a relationship, and how it's going to end. I don't know if I'm right, but that's what it sounds like to me.
Ground Truth: I love/hate this song, I have a strage relationship with it... It reminds me of this girl I used to date who was always talking 'bout being free and never letting yourself get attached to anything, and how our relationship never really worked 'cause I'm somewhat the opposite, I'm very down-to-earth and I wanted to marry her (I was 21 and she was 22, and I loved her so much...) and be with her all the time and I found this song shortly after it was over and immediatly thought of her. I imagined myself as the polar bear of the title, this very heavy animal, bound to the ground, looking up to a seagull (another song in the 'Nowhere' album is called that, as you must know) flying freely in the sky and not being able to reach to her because he can't fly like she does no matter how hard he tries... This song means a lot to me, it breakes my heart every time and maybe it has nothing to do with anything really, but that's how I see it. And that's how music works, right?
Lyrics: There's another world inside of me that you may never see; There's secrets in this life that I can't hide; Somewhere in this darkness there's a light that I can't find; Or maybe it's too far away; Or maybe I'm just blind; Maybe I'm just blind; ; So hold me when I'm here; Right me when I'm wrong; Hold me when I'm scared; and love me when I'm gone; Everything I am; and everything in me; Wants to be the one you wanted me to be; I'll never let you down; Even if I could; I'd give up everything if only for your good; So hold me when I'm here; Right me when I'm wrong; You can hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there; So love me when I'm gone; Love me when I'm gone; ; When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin; I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends; And roaming through this darkness I'm alive but I'm alone; Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone; ; So hold me when I'm here; Right me when I'm wrong; Hold me when I'm scared; and love me when I'm gone; Everything I am; and everything in me; Wants to be the one you wanted me to be; I'll never let you down; Even if I could; I'd give up everything if only for your good; So hold me when I'm here; Right me when I'm wrong; You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there; So love me when I'm gone; ; Maybe I'm just blind; ; So hold me when I'm here; Right me when I'm wrong; Hold me when I'm scared; and love me when I'm gone; Everything I am; and everything in me; Wants to be the one you wanted me to be; I'll never let you down; Even if I could; I'd give up everything if only for your good; So hold me when I'm here; Right me when I'm wrong; You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there; So love me when I'm gone; ; Love me when I'm gone, whoa; Love me when I'm gone; When I'm gone; When I'm gone; When I'm gone
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been through a lot and he wants to be with the girl he loves. He wants her to know that he loves her and that he would do anything for her. But he knows he can't be with her and he doesn't want to hurt her. He's trying to convince himself that he'll be there for her when she needs him most. He knows that he has to let her go, but he knows it won't happen. He just wants to hold her when he's gone. He loves her so much and he's willing to give up everything for her, even if it means breaking up with her. I love this song, it's so powerful. It's one of my all time favorite songs and I can't wait for the new album to come out.
Ground Truth: This is great. My boyfriend is in the Navy and the video they have for this song has Navy relation in it. I sent it in an e-mail to him right before he left. Everytime I hear this song, I think of his words: LOVE ME WHEN I'M GONE. AngieBearon May 26, 2009   
Lyrics: I don't need anyone; Don't need no mom and dad; Don't need no pretty face; Don't need no human race; I got some news for you; Don't even need you too; ; I got my time machine; Got my electronic dream; Sonic reducer; Ain't no loser; I'm a sonic reducer; Ain't no loser; ; People out on the streets; They don't know who I am; I watch them from my room; They all just pass me by; But I'm not just anyone; Said I'm not just anyone; ; I got my time machine; Got my electronic dream; Sonic reducer; Ain't no loser; I'm a sonic reducer; Ain't no loser; ; I'll be a pharaoh soon; Rule from some golden tomb; Things will be different then; The sun will rise from here; Then I, ll be ten feet tall; And you'll be nothing at all; I got my time machine; i got my electronic dream; sonic reducer, ain't no looser
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who wants to be a rock star, but he doesn't want to be famous. He's got his time machine, he's got the electronic dream. He doesn't need anyone else to be rockstar, he just wants to have fun. I don't know, that's just my take on it, but I think that's what it means to me.
Ground Truth: The last verse of this song is very emotional, and has even made me cry on one occasion. The unrealistic, disproportional quality to his vision of being a Pharaoh demonstrates that even though this worthless punk kid dreams of one day being greater than the world that bullies him, it will nonetheless wind up being him that will be "nothing at all," just like he already is.

Lyrics: You never go; You're always here (suffocating me); Under my skin; I cannot run away; ; Fading slowly; I give it all to you; Letting go of me; Reaching as I fall; I know it's already over now; Nothing left to lose; Loving you again; ; I know it's already over, already over now; My best defense is; Running from you (cost me everything); ; I can't resist; Take all you want from me; Breaking slowly; I give it all to you; Letting go of me; Reaching as I fall; I know it's already over now; ; Nothing left to lose; Loving you again; I know it's already over, already over now!; You're all I'm reaching for; ; It's already over; All I'm reaching for!; It's already over now; ; I give it all to you; I offer up my soul; It's already over, already over now!; Give it all to you; Letting go of me; Reaching as I fall; I know it's already over now; Nothing left to lose; Loving you again!; I know it's already over now!; It's already over now!; I know it's already over, already over
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy, and he is trying to convince her to give it all to him, but she won't do it. "I know it's already over now, nothing left to lose, loving you again"He knows that it's over, but he still loves her. "My best defense is, running from you, cost me everything"He's trying to tell her that he doesn't want to hurt her, and that he'll do anything for her, but it's too late. "You're all I'm reaching for"He wants her to love him back, even if it's only for a short time. He knows that he can't be with her forever, and it's "Already over now".
Ground Truth: What I love the most about this band is that you can really feel emotion through their voices...it really hits you. The beginning of the first chorus just sounds so longing, remorseful, and desperate...it hits right to the heart...amazing song. IceTsukion July 15, 2008   
Lyrics: So I ran faster; But it caught me here; Yes, my loyalties turned; Like my ankle; In the seventh grade; Running after Billy; Running after the rain; ; These precious things; Let them bleed, let them wash away; These, I said precious things; Let them break their hold over me; ; I, I, I, I said I go; He said, he; You go and I said, I said, I said I go with you; ; He said, you're really an ugly girl; But I like the way you play; And I died; But I thanked him; Can you believe that?; Sick, sick; Holding on to his picture; Dressing up every day; I want to smash the faces; Of those beautiful boys; Those Christian boys; ; Beautiful boys; I said, Christian boys; Beautiful boys; So you can make me come; That doesn't make you Jesus; ; These precious things; Let them bleed now, wash away; These I said precious things; Let them break their hold over me; ; I, I, I said; In and I said, you go and I, you; ; I remember, yes; In my peach party dress; No one dared; No one cared to tell me; Where the pretty girls are; Those demigods; With their nine inch nails; And little fascist panties; Tucked inside the heart of every nice girl; ; These are my, are in my life, I said; Bleed now, bleed now; These in my heart and; You in my head and; Bleed now, just bleed now; You in my heart and these in my head; And bleed now, bleed; ; I said these, oh precious things; Let them bleed, yes; Wash these things, daddy; Wash away these things; These are my precious things; Let them bleed, yes; Wash these things, daddy; Wash away these things; ; These are my precious things; Let them bleed now, girls just bleed; These are my precious things; Let them break, break their hold over me; I, I, I, I said, I said, I said; I can't let you, let you go, yes; Precious; Precious
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who's been in a relationship with a guy and he's telling her that he doesn't care about her and that he just wants to be with her. She wants to smash the faces of those beautiful boys, those Christian boys, so you can make me come, that doesn't make you jesus. I think it's about how she wants to break away from him and just be with him. It's a beautiful song, but it's not the type of song that makes you want to cry.
Ground Truth: I feel this song is about her early years in the music industry. Trying to break onto the scene in her own way, "girl with a piano" style and being rejected. I think she’s referring to her really early start in music, playing at age 4 and being accepted at Peabody. She felt like she was off to a really great start, but the idea of getting signed turned her priorities, and she stumbled. Precious Things is about trying to absolve herself of the disappointment she felt in herself for getting caught up in the popular image, and trying to make herself into something fake. She needs to sing; to bleed and wash away how much the rejection hurt, and how much it hurt when she was called a “bimbo” by billboard mag. I think she’s hoping by writing it down and singing about the pain it will help exorcise those demons. “He said you're really an ugly girl, But I like the way you play” is the record exec or whoever, saying “You don’t have the look. And that is what’s important in music right now.” She was so heartbroken and embarrassed, she just thanked him for saying she didn’t suck at playing. She knows it’s dysfunctional that she didn’t stand up for herself; she was groveling, basically. She keeps holding on to his card, and wearing the trendy trashy stuff, hoping to make it. (If you get the chance, look up the video for Tori’s song “Big Picture” on youtube.com and you’ll see what I mean.) I think she felt upset at how the pretty boys were getting all the attention. It didn’t matter if they were good musicians or could write; just how they looked with their cockatoo hair and butt-rock painted-on pants. “So you can make me cum, That doesn’t make you Jesus” He can deliver the thing she really wants, being signed to a label, but he’s not really anything in the big scheme of the world. I think the “peach party dress” bit is about how she didn’t know where she fit in; she couldn’t figure out the party to be at to get into the “in” crowd, musically. I see her in like a really pretty ruffled thing, and all the other girls are in red

Lyrics: Wake up my love; Never thought you'd make me, break me; Now I'm up from below; Such a brilliant star you are; ; And will your love keep burning baby; Burn a hole right through my eyes; All these short times feel like no time; I thought you ought to know; ; I'm so far gone now I been running on empty; I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me on?; ; Do, do you, do you know?; Do you know how long I've waited? to look up from below; Just to find someone like you?; And will your love light burn me baby?; ; Burn a hole right through my heart; I think I might just trust you, maybe; But I'm not sure; I'm not sure I wanna know; ; I'm so far gone now I been running on empty; I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me high?; I'm so far gone now I been running on empty; I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me on?; ; I think you could make me girl; Could make me and take my life; I know you could break me girl; Take all of me all of me, yeah; ; Wake up my love; Never thought you'd make me, break me; Now I'm up from below; Such a brilliant star you are; ; I'm so far gone now I been running on empty; I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me high?; I'm so far gone now I been running on empty; I'm so far gone now do you wanna take me on?; Do you wanna take me on?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been waiting for a girl for a long time, but she doesn't seem to be interested in him. He's waiting for her to come around, but he doesn't know how long he has waited for her. He thinks he might just trust her but he's not sure if he should trust her or not. He just wants to know if she'll come around. I love this song. I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I can't wait to see them in concert.
Ground Truth: i think he's referring to past relationships he's had when he says "i never thought you'd make me brake me" like, he loved and trusted someone alot and they did something to hurt him...then he meets someone new and thinks hes "so far gone" and hes been going on with nothing to live for possibly? (been running on empty) so after explaining this to her asks "do u want to take me on?" and says "i might just trust you maybe.." so basically i think this song is about how he got over someone that hurt him alot and is thinking about getting into and new relationship with someone he really like (do you know how long ive waited to look up from below just to find someone like you) but then hes worried he'll get hurt again (And will your love light burn me baby,Burn a hole right through my heart ) and he worries she could hurt him very badly, maybe worse than before (I think you could make me girl,Could make me take my lifeI know you could break me girl) so since its about sex i guess...maybe hes debating whether or not he should have sex with her because hes worried about getting attatched...? well theres what i think. god enough,angelofdeath79on August 25, 2005   
Lyrics: Hold the pose, a perfect picture; Just so I remember how you're looking tonight; Let it go, now the days gone; Standing in the dark, although we've turned on the lights; ; Tonight we will deny, that time is passing by; It's leaving you and I to...; ; Freeze; A moment, its never been better; Freeze; All over, we won't last forever; You said that you're sorry for pushing me; But then smiled when I opened my eyes; I'm gonna; Freeze; A moment, while we're together; ; Keep the peace, by gones be gone; Coming up the rain under the life that we've made; Under here, we're not so soft; Forgiving the feeling that we put on parade; ; Tonight we will deny, that time is passing by; It's leaving you and I to...; ; Freeze; A moment, its never been better; Freeze; All over, we won't last forever; You said that you're sorry for pushing me; But then smiled when I opened my eyes; I'm gonna; Freeze; A moment, while we're together; ; Don't stop, gotta know what you got; There's no second chances in life; Don't break, gotta give what you take; With you; ; Freeze; A moment, its never been better; Freeze; All over, we won't last forever; ; Freeze; A moment, its never been better; I Freeze; All over, we won't last forever; You looked at me with the truth in your eyes; And you said it's ok, you can go; I'm gonna; Freeze; This moment, while we're together; ; Freeze; A moment
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy and a girl who broke up, but he wants to be with her again. "Hold the pose, a perfect pictureJust so I remember how you're looking tonightLet it go, now the days goneStanding in the darkAlthough we've turned on the lightsTonight we will deny, that time is passing byIt's leaving you and I to"He wants to have a good time with her, but she doesn't want to. "You said that you're sorry for pushing meBut then smiled when I opened my eyesI'm gonna freezeA moment while we're togetherKeep the peace, by gones be goneComing up the rain under the life that we've madeUnder here, we're not so softForgiving the feeling that we put on parade"He's telling her that he doesn't feel the same way about her, and he's not willing to let go of her. "Under here we're so soft forgiving the feel that we had on parade." He's saying that he can't give up on her, because she's not as good as he used to be, and that he's going to freeze a moment while they're together. "Don't stop, gotta know what you gotThere's no second chances in lifeDon't break, gotta give what you take with you"He just wants her to know that he loves her, so he can give her what she wants. "FreezeA moment, it's never been betterI FreezeAll over, we won't last foreverYou looked at me with the truth in your eyesAnd you said it's ok, you can goI'm going to FreezeThis moment while you're together"He knows that they're not going to last forever, and she can't stop loving him, so she can give him what he wants, and give him a chance to get her back. He just wants to enjoy the moment with her. He's gonna freeze this moment while she's with him, because it's a perfect moment, and it's the only time they can be together.

Lyrics: That night I remember what you slipped in my glass; We came rewinding when; I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me; And now my shape is kept; ; The rain it can't hide, wash the paint from this hex; Is it so permanent?; Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times; Or once just to seal you in?; ; In your drunken breath, did it stain like us?; In place of poison heat; I gotta rid this world of your intention; Swap the corpse in the casket; ; Give me that corpse please; The one that tore nightly; I really want it now; Fold the arms slowly; Don't want you to hold me; It fits just like a glove; Does he make you feel alive?; ; When I seep inside your truth; Through suspicious little coughs; You sank your nails inside a key; While the door you shut closed up; ; The black stockings you kept, smell of wet cigarette; Torn of lust that you could not keep; I have slept inside your fault; To have you keep me here on this leash; ; For the rest of your pets, I will feed to the theft; As we consummate the vows of defeat; And when you pray for an end to this; I do believe this is eternity; ; Give me that corpse please; The one that tore nightly; I really want it now; Fold the arms slowly; Don't want you to hold me; It fits just like a glove; Your closet is bulging; White marrow withholding; Does it make you feel alright?; ; Give me that corpse please; The one that tore nightly; I really want it now; Fold the arms slowly; Don't want you to hold me; It fits just like a glove; Your closet is bulging; White marrow withholding; Does it make you feel alright?; ; Ahhh...; ; Never heard a man speak like this man before; Never heard a man speak like this man before; All the days of my life, ever since I've been born; Never heard a man speak like this man before; Watch me now; ; Say it, say it, say it loud; Say it, say it, say it loud; Hold your heavy burden; In a pocket full of drink that I have drunk; Spit the remnants in your direction; This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come; ; I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming on; It's numbing a stump clearing in my throat; And I just can't lose grip of it; She fumigated my mental hygiene; I'm all out of pulse; But I know you can resuscitate me; ; Never heard a man speak like this man before; Never heard a man speak like this man before; All the days of my life, ever since I've been born; Never heard a man speak like this man before; ; Ahhh...; ; Never heard a man speak like this man before; Never heard a man speak like this man before; All the days of my life, ever since I've been born; Never heard a man speak like this man before; Watch me now
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has a relationship with a woman who is cheating on him. He wants to get rid of her by killing her. "Give me that corpse pleaseThe one that tore nightlyI really want it now"He wants her to give him what he wants. He feels like he can't have her, but he knows that she will do anything for him. "The rain it can't hide, wash the paint from this hexIs it so permanent? Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times or once just to seal you in?" He feels that she cheated on him, and he wants to know if she did it again. "In your drunken breath, did it stain like us? In place of poison heatI gotta rid this world of your intention Swap the corpse in the casket"He feels that he needs to kill her, so he kills her, and kills her. This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come. "I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming onIt's numbing a stump clearing in my throatAnd I just can't lose grip of itShe fumigated my mental hygieneI'm all out of pulseBut I know you can resuscitate me"This is the most powerful part of the song. I think it's about how he feels like she is killing him, killing him. It's like he's begging her to forgive him, because he knows she's doing it. "Never heard a man speak like this man beforeAll the days of my life, ever since I've been born"He doesn't know how to deal with it anymore. He's not sure if she'll forgive him or not. "Say it, say it,Say it loudHold your heavy burdenIn a pocket full of drink that I have drunkSpit the remnants in your direction"He's trying to get over her. She's giving him what she wants, but it's too late. He can't. He knows she won't forgive him. So he's telling her that he'll be there for her, even though she's not going to let him get away with it. He doesn't want her to know that he's doing this to her. He just wants to let her go. "This is a close to any Kingdom that you'll come"He knows that he won't get out of this relationship. "And when you pray for an end to thisI do believe this is eternity"He hopes that he can make her

Lyrics: Suddenly I found; That I'd lost my way in this city; The streets and the thousands of colors; All bleed into one; ; I fall down, Heaven won't help me; I call out, no one would hear; ; All of a sudden; I'd lost my way out of the city; ; Stand tall, stand proud; ; Every beginning; Is breaking its promise; I'm having trouble; Just finding my soul in this town; ; The names on the faces in places; They mean nothing to me; It's all they can do; To be part of the queue in this town; ; I fall down, Heaven won't help me; I call out, no one will hear; ; Be no tomorrow they say; Well, I say more's the pity; ; Stand tall, stand proud; ; Every beginning; Is breaking its promise; I'm having trouble; Just finding my soul in this town; ; Stand tall, stand proud; ; Every beginning; Is breaking its promise; I'm having trouble; Just finding my soul in this town; ; Finding my soul in this town; ; Keep on trying; Keep on trying; Keep on trying; ...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who has fallen in love with a city. He has lost his way in the city, and he is trying to find his soul in this city. The names on the faces in places, they mean nothing to me, it's all they can do to be part of the queue in this town. I think this is a metaphor for how he feels about the city and how he can't seem to find the right person to be with.
Ground Truth: I don't get this song - can someone tell me where the goodness of this song lies? I can't really stand it to tell the truth. There's nothing in this song that catches on. The solo, is quite nice, but elsewise, it's not much to say. Worst song on the album. The cageon December 18, 2005   
Lyrics: Trapped in purgatory; A lifeless object, alive; Awaiting reprisal; Death will be their acquittance; ; The sky is turning red; Return to power draws near; Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears; Abolish the rules made of stone; ; Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past; Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above; ; Awaiting the hour of reprisal; Your time slips away; ; Raining blood; From a lacerated sky; Bleeding its horror; Creating my structure; Now I shall reign in blood
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who has been betrayed by a group of people and is now trying to repress them. "Trapped in purgatoryA lifeless object, aliveAwaiting reprisalDeath will be their acquittanceThe sky is turning redReturn to power draws nearFall into me, the sky's crimson tearsAbolish the rules made of stonePierced from below, souls of my treacherous pastBetrayed by manyNow ornaments dripping aboveAwaiting the hour of reprisalYour time slips awayRaining bloodFrom a lacerated skyBleeding its horrorCreating my structureNow I shall reign in blood"This part is my favorite part of the song. "Raining Blood From a Lacerated SkyBleeding Its HorrorCreating My StructureNow I Shall Reign In Blood"This is one of my favorite songs of all time. I can't wait to see them live at warped tour in September.
Ground Truth: What the ****? The whole comment didn't show up... Oh well, what I was trying to point out was that you've got it wrong - While the ALBUM TITLE is named "Reign in Blood", the SONG TITLE is by the name "Raining Blood". In other words, a sound-similarity, word-difference play. Oh well, a simply great thrash song, maybe even one of the greatest of all history of music (The noise solo for the win!). And yes, I do believe Pootangmagnet's theory is true. It sounds logical enough to me. :)Rusty Diamondson March 09, 2008   Link1 Reply

Lyrics: Oh, girl, I don't know all the reasons why,; ; I found the answer lookin' in your eye.; I go out walking all day long,; Take away this lonely man, soon he will be gone.; 'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free.; Yes, I can see you, girl, can you see me?; You don't need to know what I do all day,; ; It's as much as I know, watch it waste away.; 'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free.; Yes, I can see you, girl, can you see me?; Go and see the sorcerer, look into a ball,; ; You might find the answer written on the wall.; The left one was a dancer, can you see the answer?; Oh!; Put her in a mansion on top of the hill,; ; Please don't make her do things against her will.; I found something special, I don't know why,; Looking into her pretty little eye.; 'Cause I'll tell you everything about being free...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who's in love with a girl, but he doesn't know why. He's trying to convince her that he can see her, but she doesn't seem to understand. He doesn't want to make her do things against her will, so he tells her to "put her in a mansion on top of the hill" and not to make him do these things against his will. I love this song.
Ground Truth: “This is a song about innocence lost.” as stated in the very beginning of the song... Anyone ever think that this song could be about a boy corrupting a girl to set her "free" for his own selfish needs? amandamon June 18, 2010   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: It doesn't hurt me; Do you wanna feel how it feels?; Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?; Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?; You; It's you and me; ; And if I only could; I'd make a deal with God; And I'd get him to swap our places; Be running up that road; Be running up that hill; Be running up that building; See if I only could, oh; ; You don't wanna hurt me; But see how deep the bullet lies; Unaware I'm tearing you asunder; Oh, there is thunder in our hearts; ; Is there so much hate for the ones we love?; Well tell me, we both matter, don't we?; You; It's you and me; It's you and me won't be unhappy; ; And if I only could; I'd make a deal with God; And I'd get him to swap our places; Be running up that road; Be running up that hill; Be running up that building; Say, if I only could, oh; ; You; It's you and me; It's you and me won't be unhappy; ; Oh c'mon, baby, c'mon darling; Let me steal this moment from you now; C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling; Let's exchange the experience, oh; ; And if I only could; I'd make a deal with God; And I'd get him to swap our places; I'd be running up that road; Be running up that hill; With no problems; ; See and if I only could; I'd make a deal with God; And I'd get him to swap our places; Be running up that road; Be running up that hill; With no problems; ; So if I only could; I'd make a deal with God; And I'd get him to swap our places; I'd be running up that road; Be running up that hill; With no problems; ; So if I only could; Be running up that hill; With no problems; ; If I only could, I'd be running up that hill; If I only could, I'd be running up that hill

She wants to know if he loves her or not, and if he doesn't love her, she wants him to know that it doesn't hurt her. She just wants to be with him, and that she would be running up that hill with no problems. I think it's about a guy who loves a girl, and she wants to tell him that she loves him, but he's afraid to tell her, because he'll hurt her too much. It's a beautiful song, and I love the way she sings it.
Ground Truth: wow so only rachel got it almost exactly right, this song has been misinterpreted many many times. but the song is, and it came from kate herself, about the fact that men and women don´t understand eachother. and someone wrote about the fact that it was supposed to be called deal with god at the beginning and that´s correct. they were afraid radiostations in different countries wouldn´t play the song. she chose to sing "make a deal with god" instead of the phrase so often used "make a deal with the devil" cause it was more beautiful to make a deal with god instead of the devil. and seeing as brian molko, singer of placebo has breasts and obviously a torn sexuality it´s kind of obvious why they made a cover about this song. spiiikeon October 16, 2007   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Baby's black balloon makes her fly; I almost fell into that hole in your life; You're not thinking about tomorrow; 'Cause you were the same as me; But on your knees.; ; A thousand other boys could never reach you; How could I have been the one?; I saw the world spin beneath you; And scatter like ice from the spoon; That was your womb.; ; Coming down, the world turned over; And angels fall without you there; And I go on as you get colder; Or are you someone's prayer?; ; You know the lies they always told you; And the love you never knew; Was it things they never showed you?; That swallowed the light from the sun; Inside your room, yeah.; ; Coming down, the world turned over; And Angels fall without you there; And I go on as you get colder; Always someone's prayer; ; And there's no time left for losing; When you stand, they fall, yeah.; ; Coming down, the world turned over; And angels fall without you there; And I go on as you get colder; All because I'm; Coming down, the years turned over; And Angels fall without you there; And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and; All because I'm; All because I'm; And I'll become what you became to me
Sample outputs: I think this song is about drugs. "Baby's black balloon makes her flyI almost fell into that hole in your lifeYou're not thinking about tomorrow'Cause you were the same as meBut on your knees"I think he's talking about a girl who is addicted to drugs, and he's trying to get her to stop thinking about what she's going to do. "A thousand other boys could never reach youHow could I have been the oneI saw the world spin beneath youAnd scatter like ice from the spoonThat was your womb"He's talking to her, asking her if she can get through the addiction. "Comin' down, the years turned overAnd angels fall without you thereAnd I go on as you get colderOr are you someone's prayer?" He's telling her that he'll always be there for her, no matter what. "You know the lies they always told youAnd the love you never knewWas it the things they never showed youThat swallowed the light from the sunInside your room"He doesn't know what to do with her, but she doesn't want him to know, because she's addicted to the drugs. He's reassuring her that she won't have to deal with the pain of the addiction, because he'll be there to help her through the hard times. "And there's no time left for losingWhen you stand, they fallYeah"He tells her that even though she's dying, she'll always have the love she never knew, and that he will always be a part of her life. "I'll become what you became to me"He'll be the one she became to him, and she'll be what he became to her.
Ground Truth: This song is about a boy and a girl who have unprotected sex and she gets pregnant, not sex for physical reasons but for love. She is a troubled girl and neither one of them is ready for the financial or emotional responsibility of having a baby. As much as she doesn't want to have an abortion she does out of fear, because she suffers low self esteem and confidence because of how she was brought up and because she knows that he is not ready also. The song truly describes the feelings and emotions of a girl who suffers post traumatic abortion syndrome, and how she suffers and puts herself in the line of fire because of her love for the boy but regrets the abortion after. The toll it takes on her, and ultimately makes them both ponder in silence what was worse? The toll having a baby would have taken on their relationship or the toll that the post abortion is starting to take now. SoulChaseron August 12, 2007   
Lyrics: We entered Winter once again; Naked, freezing from my breath; Neath the lid all limbs tucked away; This coffin is your abode from now and onwards; ; Your body is mine to avail; Such a tragic sight you are; Slave under my creed; Spurring me with those tears; ; I am beyond death; Midst a dreaming affinity; Saving strength now, faint whispers; Come erotic communion in its splendour; ; Fever mirrored ghosts; Night time consolation, cross the line; Draw murder into art; Sleep inside through days; ; In the wake of this relief; Shivering, longing for more; Insanity at its peak; Love me to my death; ; Lost are days of Spring; You sighted and let me in; Keep the beast inside; Shackled within my hide; Screaming out too late; Losing to my hate; ; Grew together with your skin; And paced the trails of sin; Your gaze covered with virgin snow; Rigid features; It's the shallow deeds who is to blame; Deafening shrieks pierced the night; ; A step from oblivion; Moving into the dim lights; Hiding within a reverie; It was worth it for the wait alone; Your body is mine to avail; Such a tragic sight you are; Slave under my creed; Spurring me with those tears; ...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a woman, but can't get her out of his mind. He is obsessed with her, and she is his to avail. She is his body to avail, and he is beyond death. He can't sleep without her, so he kills her. The only thing he can do is kill her, but he can't let her go, because he doesn't want her to die. He has to kill her. I think this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, and I can't wait to see them live.
Ground Truth: Ok Ok Ok... I created an account just for this song. I've listen to this so many times and saw the lyrics even more often. First of all YES ! it's about rape and murder NO there's no leprosy in this. A leper is also and outcast which is the case here. The last sentence confirm it "It was worth it for the wait alone". Is a way to say, it's my vengeance to the world. Ok lets take the lyrics part by part. "We entered Winter once again"Keep in mind that's the first lyrics of the album, it means we forgot the happy ending of still life : this is gonna be raw and cold, like winter. "Naked, freezing from my breath"Have you ever felt the breath of someone in your neck ? "Neath the lid all limbs tucked awayThis coffin is your abode from now"He's above, she can't move"Your body is mine to availSuch a tragic sight you areSlave under my creedSpurring me with those tears"This is were insanity begins, feeling all powerful makes him bursting in madness"I am beyond death"A lot of murderers, rapists etc... felt the same when they commited their crimes, feeling like god because you play with the life of someone"Midst a dreaming affinitySaving strength now, faint whispersCome erotic communion in its splendourFever mirrored ghosts"She lost strength and resigned to fight, she let him do the dirty job, he fucks her"Night time consolation, cross the lineDraw murder into artSleep inside through daysIn the wake of this reliefShivering, longing for moreInsanity at it's peakLove me to my death"He kills her, obvious enough : night means death, "cross the line" "Insanity at it's peak""Lost are days of SpringYou sighted and let me inKeep the beast insideShackled within my hideScreaming out too lateLosing to my hateGrew together with your skinAnd paced the trails of sin"I can pretty much see the scene clearly. His madness stoped, he stand amazed, got scared. Then he talk to her, yell, and tell her it's her fault. MAAAAN i can almost see his eyes, in a mix of surprize, fear and anger. "Your gaze covered with virgin snowRigid featuresIt's the sh
Lyrics: Last stop for a resolution.; End of the line, is it confusion? So go.; Go and see what's there for you.; Nothing new; nothing new for you to use.; ; I've got no new act to amuse you.; I've got no desire to use you, you know.; But anything that I could do; Would never be; Good enough for you.; ; If you can't help it, then just...; Leave it alone.; Leave it alone...; Yeah, just forget it.; It's really easy.; I believe I'll forget it too.; ; Still, you're keeping me around; 'Til I finally drag us both down!; Pulling feathers out your hat...; Yes, I believe that's where it's at.; ; You belong tagging along,; And I belong in the zoo.; ; (Ahhhhhh...); ; So I wait for confirmation; That you're never gonna use your starting gun.; Unless he's me, it sounds like; Being him just wasn't that much fun.; ; Anything that I could do; Would never be; Good enough for you.; If you can't help it, then just...; Leave it alone.; Leave me alone...; Yeah, just forget it.; It's really easy, I'll just forget it too.; ; Coast to coast... coast to coast...; ; I'll do what I can so you can be what you do.; Coast to coast... coast to coast...; I'll do everything I can so you can be what you do.; Coast to coast... coast to coast...; ; Circuit rider comes every fifth Sunday.; Oh my lord, I fell asleep one day.; ; Anything that I could do...; Is there anything that I could do,; That someone doesn't do for you?; That someone didn't do for you?; That I've already done for you?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has a crush on a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him. He is trying to convince her to leave him alone, but he doesn't know how to do it, so he tells her to "go and see what's there for you" because he knows it won't work out. He wants her to know that he will always be there for her, and he will never be good enough for her. "I've got no new act to amuse you, I got no desire to use you, you knowBut anything that I could doWould never be Good enough for youIf you can't help it, then just leave it aloneLeave it alone, yeah just forget itIt's really easy, I believe I'll forget it tooStill you're keeping me around 'til I finally drag us both downPulling feathers out your hatYes I believe that's where it's atYou belong tagging alongAnd I belong in the zooSo I wait for confirmationThat you're never gonna use your starting gunUnless he's me, it sounds likeBeing him just wasn't that much fun"I think he is saying that he won't let her go, and that he'll do anything he can to make her stay with him, even if it means hurting her in the process. He will do anything to keep her around, even though she will eventually leave him. "Circuit rider comes every fifth SundayOh my lord, I fell asleep one dayAnything that I can do, is there anything that i could doThat someone doesn't do for youThat someone didn't doFor you? That I've already done for you?" I think this part means that he is telling her that he can't do anything for her because he's already done something for her and he's done something to help her. The Circuit rider is the "circuit rider" that comes to visit her on Sundays, and they are always there for each other, and the Circuit Rider is the one who takes care of her. This is just my interpretation of the song.
Ground Truth: This song's from the yet to be released last album from Elliott Smith known as 'From A Basement On The Hill.' Some words about this song from Elliott's last interview: "This one was called Circuit Rider but not any more. This song I don't play everything on. This one actually has two drummers on it. One is Steve Drozd from the Flaming Lips and the other is the drummer for the Lillies. Steve and I are good friends and we've both had similar situations and we have both improved in the same way. I asked this friend of mine to make up something he could say as fast as he could in fifteen minutes about people healing themselves or being unable to heal themselves. While he's saying this thing there is a main vocal that goes over that." planetearthon July 03, 2004

Lyrics: I'm not afraid of the black man running; He's got it right, he's got a better life comin'; And I don't care what the Captain said; I fold it right at the top of my head; I lost my sight and the state packs in; I follow my heart and it leads me right to Jackson; ; (Oh Keller, oh oh oh oh); She gave us a medal she gave us a map; (Oh Canner Row, oh oh oh); If seeing is right, then look where you're at; ; I'm not afraid of Nichol's Park; I ride the train and I ride it after dark; And I'm not afraid to get it right; I turn around and I give it one more try; And I said things that I meant to say; The bandstand chairs and the Dewey Day Parade; I go out to the Golden Age; The spirit is right and the spirit doesn't change; ; (Oh Keller, oh oh oh oh); She gave us a mirror, she gave us a map; (Oh Canner Row, oh oh oh); If seeing is right, then look where you're at; ; Andrew Jackson! All I'm asking; Show us the wheel, and give us the wine; Raise the Banner, Jackson Hammer!; Everyone goes to the capitol line; Colored Preacher, nice to meet you!; The spirit is here, and the spirit is fine; Education! Ask the nation!; You gave us our sight and the hearing is fine; Andrew Jackson! All I'm asking; Give us the wheel, and give us the wine
Sample outputs: This song is about Andrew Jackson. He's not afraid of the black man running, he's got it right, he got a better life coming, and I don't care what the Captain said. I fold it right at the top of my head. I lost my sight and the state packs in. I follow my heart and it leads me right to Jackson. I love this song, it's so powerful. It's a great song.
Ground Truth: Yeah, Doc, you've pissed me off too... just because the lyrics wouldn't stand as poetry doesn't render them meaningless. Poets have to form their words around a meter, rhyme scheme, etc... lyricists have all that to deal with, along with a melody. These are reasons why it takes much longer to extract the meaning from poetry than it does to extract it from prose, and they also make it even harder to extract the meaning from lyrics when you're just looking at them printed on the page. But when combined with the MUSIC, a lot of times you can get the general message. Lyrics are no place for COMPLICATED philosophical dissertations, but you can still get deep ideas with them, and they are better than poetry if you are trying for imagery, which is one of the main goals of an album about a place, or so I presume. This song, with it's bluesy-jazzy undertones, lyrics, etc.... well, it just conjures the underground railroad. Now, would it do that if you didn't know the lyrics? Probably not. But when the lyrics combine with the music, it hits you, and powerfully. stupid_nameon May 01, 2006   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: A fugitive from unreality; No sign of my god damned serenity; Lost in these barren lands; That have nothing I demand; Had to look for something new; And that day I found you; I found you, I found you; ; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; ; A qvasar from reality; With damaged mentality; I'll start editing your life; Replace the captain of your brain ship; Before we set sail for the fail; ; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; ; My destiny outruns me; And I can't find that key; To lock up everything that's bad inside of me; Don't you disagree; That your life would be; So much better without me, that isn't hard to see; Hard to see; ; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about; Living in a house of cards; Waiting for it all to fall; Hope for the best, plan for the worst; That's what my life is all about
Sample outputs: I think this song is about being in a house of cards, waiting for it all to fall, hoping for the best, plan for the worst, that's what my life is all about. A qvasar from realityWith damaged mentalityI'll start editing your lifeReplace the captain of your brain shipBefore we set sail for the fail. I think this means that he is trying to escape from the reality of the world, but he can't get out of his mind, so he is going to start editing his own life. Don't you disagreeThat your life would beSo much better without meThat isn't hard to seeHard to see.
Ground Truth: I think that this song is about how the governments turn their backs on the people. I mean, we have all seen the anarchistic influences in SS's later songs, like "Revolution, Baby", "Burn This City", "Power Shift" so forth and et cetera. This song in particular feels to me like a cry for help, they know what will come, but they can't really do anything about it... Actually this whole album is in my mind their own thoughts of giving up, whereas the songs from the new album (that are currently released) are the more cocky versions.
Lyrics: I heard a puff, I heard a blow; I felt the ground, I felt the snow; I thought of linen and old lace; I never really saw his face; I heard a grunt, I heard a moan; I felt the sun, I saw the moon; I saw the northern light above; And the eclipse of the sun; I am a breath, I am a wish; I am a rocket, And a fish; I felt his measures and his weight; My own body as a scale; You heard a whisper in my ear; You are not here, you are not there; I saw the northern light above; The eclipse of the sun; My feet was hurt, my knees were sore; And I wondered why he burned; And I wondered why he burned; ; I heard a puff, I heard a blow; I felt the ground, I felt the snow; I thought of linen and of lace; I never really saw his face; I heard a grunt, I heard a moan; I felt the sun, I saw the moon; I saw the northern light above; And the eclipse of the sun; I am a breath, I am a wish; I am a rocket, And a fish; I felt his measures and his weight; My own body as a scale; You heard a whisper in my ear; You are not here, you are not there; So in love that I could die; The eclipse of the sun; My feet was hurt, my knees were sore; And I wondered why it burned; And I wondered why it burned; ; Then I had to climb down; I went up to see the sun rise; And then I had to climb back up again; I had to be there to see the sun rise; For the air that you sent to guide me; Had a tonne of elephant grey; We were all there in the morning; We were there and we wanted to stay; Then I had to climb down; I went up to see the sun rise; And then I had to climb back up again; I had to be there to see the sun rise; For the air that you sent to guide me; Had a tonne of elephant grey; We were all there in the morning; We were there and we wanted to stay
Sample outputs: This song is about being in love with someone who is not there for you. You have to be there to see the sun rise, and then you have to climb back up again. It's a beautiful song. I love it.
Ground Truth: Obvious sexual references here, but I think magicman7 is right when he says that people heard it was rape or a fling, but Karin didn't really know how she should feel, because of being a virgin (linen and lace)so she can't confirm either way. She seems to be in a bubble and once she comes out of it (the sun rising) she doesn't know what just happened or if she enjoyed it, blurring the lines between rape and consensual sex so she goes back up to see the sunrise but she went without him and she goes back to get himto see if the normal world can mix with the bubble. In the end, she says they wanted to stay. She made up her mind that it wasn't rape. Maybe the title Kino is a reference to her physical perception of everything. This is dictionary.com's definition of kinaesthetic: "muscle sense. The sensation by which bodily position, weight, muscle tension, and movement are perceived". This seems to sum the song up very well, especially when directly saying she feels the snow and how her body is the scale which measures him. I spent longer analysing this than I have on most of my college essays :/ unemployment, here I come...newyorkcityspeedon January 20, 2012   
Lyrics: Yeah; Yeah; Come on; Here we go again, motherfucker; Yeah; ; Come on down and see the idiot right here; Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care; What's the matter with calamity anyway?; Right? Get the fuck outta my face; Understand I can't feel anything; It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay; I feel like a wound like I got a fucking gun against my head; You live when I'm dead; ; One more time, motherfucker; ; Everybody hates me now, so fuck it; Blood's on my face and my hands; And I don't know why I'm not afraid to cry; But that's none of your business; Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it?; Spin it around so I can spit in its face; I wanna leave without a trace; 'Cause I don't wanna die in this place; ; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit, what you gonna do?; People equal shit, 'cause I'm not afraid of you; People equal shit, I'm everything you'll never be; People equal shit, yeah; ; Come on; It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone; Contagion, I'm sitting at the side of Satan; What do you want from me?; They never told me the failure I was meant to be; Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it; Stop your bitching and fight your way through it; I'm not like you, I just fuck up; Come on, motherfucker, everybody has to die; Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die; ; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit, yeah; People equal shit, yeah; People equal shit, yeah; People equal shit, yeah; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit; People equal shit, what you gonna do?; People equal shit, 'cause I'm not afraid of you; People equal shit, I'm everything you'll never be; People equal shit; ; Got that, right?
Sample outputs: I think that this song is about how people are so fucked up that they don't even know what to do. People are so screwed up because they are so fucking fucked up. If you think about it, people are fucked up because of their actions. I think that is the point of this song. I don't know if it's true or not, but that's what I get out of it. I just think it's a good song to listen to when you're depressed. I also think it has to be one of the best songs on the album. I can't wait for the album to come out. It's just so fucking amazing. I'm going to have to buy the CD and listen to the rest of the songs. I love this song, it's so fuckin awesome.
Ground Truth: I just saw Slipknot yesterday in concert and they fucking rock. As far as this song goes i do think that people=shit. It's in human nature to destroy each other. Anyway to all of you people who are dissing on Slipknot: Listen to their new CD. They've really progressed/matured since their first 2 albums. I used to hate Slipknot, but now i really like them because of the new album. It's no longer all about screaming (they have catchy melodies and even two acoustic songs). If not, i still understand why you wouldn't like them. Their music (especially their first two albums) has a lot of different things going on at once. It sounds uncomfortable to the human ear. It's kind of like Jazz. A lot of people don't like jazz because there is oftentimes so much going on that it is near impossible to hear and just sounds like incoherent noise. I think Slipknot is sort of the same way. Anyway, awesome song !!! bush_h8eron April 07, 2005   
Lyrics: Nobody likes you; Everyone left you; They're all out without you; Having fun; ; Where have all the bastards gone?; The underbelly stacks up ten high; The dummy failed the crash test; Collecting unemployment checks; Like a flunkie along for a ride; ; Where have all the riots gone; As your city's model gets pulverized?; What's in love is now in debt; On your birth certificate; So strike the fucking match to light this fuse; ; The town bishop is an extortionist; And he don't even know that you exist; Standing still when it's do or die; You better run for your fucking life; ; It's not over till your underground; It's not over before it's too late; It's cities burnin'; It's not my burden; It's not over before it's too late; There's nothing left to analyze; ; Where will all the martyrs go; When the virus cures itself?; And where will we all go when it's too late?; ; And don't look back; You're not the Jesus of Suburbia; The St. Jimmy is a figment of; Your father's rage and your mother's love; Made me the idiot America; ; It's not over till your underground; It's not over before it's too late; It's cities burnin'; It's not my burden; It's not over before it's too late; ; Well, she said I can't take this place; I'm leaving it behind; Well, she said I can't take this town; I'm leaving you tonight
Sample outputs: I think that this song is about the end of the world, and how it's too late to change things. I think it's about how the world is fucked up, and it's not over until it is too late. It's also about how there's nothing left to do about it, and the only way to fix it is to go back to the way things were before. Just my two cents. I love this song, and I can't wait for the album to come out.
Ground Truth: I think this song ties together almost everything. I think that jimmy and Jesus are the same person because all the letters in the cd jacket are addressed to "J" for jimmy or Jesus, and the song states that "st. jimmy is a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love" and "your not the Jesus of suburbia" this explains the "oh therapy can you please fill the void" in part 4 of Jesus of suburbia. his home life made him, "Jesus," lose his Identity so he when to therapy. and I think that in homecoming when jimmy dies its the death of the alter ego. that’s what is meant by "he blew his brains out into the bay in the state of mind in my own private suicide." So with the death of jimmy, the rebellious drug using city punk, Jesus goes to “filling out paperwork”whatsernameon December 26, 2004

Lyrics: Wake up, wake up; This is no hallucination; This is what we have become; This is what dreams are made of; Go look in the mirror; ; Wake up, wake up; This is no hallucination; Wake up, wake up; This is no hallucination; ; Do we still exist?; I can't see my face; Or are we just not here?; I can't see my face; ; Wake up, wake up; This is no hallucination; This is what we have become; When you know what dreams are made of; ; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Come on, come on you've got to wake the fuck up; ; Wake up, wake up; This is more than you bargained for; It took so long so you ate some more; You did too much man, you did too much; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up; Wake up, wake up
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how we have become what we want to be. We have become everything we want and we need to wake up and realize that our dreams are made of what we really want. "This is no hallucination, this is what we have been. When you know what dream is made of"This part is saying that we are now what we are. We are not what we used to be, and we are not who we are today. "Do we still exist? I can't see my face, or are we just not here?" This part is talking about the fact that we have changed, and that we do not need to pretend to be who we really are. "It took so long so you ate some more. You did too much man, you did to much." This part of the song is basically saying that this is all we want, and it took too long for us to realize it. "Wake up, wake up. This is more than you bargained for. It took so much so you did some more." This is just my opinion, but I think it is a great song.
Ground Truth: Are these correct? coz i see these on darklyrics.com and they make more sence then these(but i could be wrong). Wake up, wake upThis is no hallucinationThis is what we have becomeThis what dreams are made ofGo look in the mirrorWake up, wake upThis is no hallucinationDo we still exist?

Lyrics: There's a place off Ocean Avenue; Where I used to sit and talk with you; We were both 16 and it felt so right; Sleeping all day staying up all night; Staying up all night; ; There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street; We would walk on the beach in our bare feet; We were both 18 and it felt so right; Sleeping all day staying up all night; ; Staying up all night; ; If I could find you now things would get better; ; We could leave this town and run forever; Let your waves crash down on me and take me away; ; There's a piece of you thats here with me; It's everywhere I go its everything I see; ; When I sleep I dream and it gets me by; I can make believe that you're here tonight; That you're here tonight; If I could find you now things would get better; ; We could leave this town and run forever; I know somewhere somehow we'll be together; Let your waves crash down on me and take me away; I remember the look in your eyes; When I told you that this was goodbye; You were begging me not tonight; Not here, not now; We're looking up at the same night sky; ; And keep pretending the sun will not rise; Well be together for one more night somewhere somehow; If I could find you now things would get better; We could leave this town and run forever; I know somewhere somehow we'll be together; Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy and a girl who used to hang out on the beach, and now that they're back together, things will be better. "i remember the look in your eyeswhen i told you that this was goodbyeyou were begging me not tonightnot here not nowwe're looking up at the same night skyand keep pretending the sun will not risewell be together for one more night somewhere somehowif i could find you nowthings would get betterwe could leave this town and run foreverlet your waves crash down on me and take me away"this part makes me think of this guy and his girl, and how they used to be together, but now they're apart and everything's fine, and he wants her back, and she's begging him not tonight, not here, not now.
Ground Truth: its a great song, it reminds of when i was younger and life was simpler. i remember getting this cd when it came out 3 or so years ago and it was the cd i wasted my summer away to....hard to think that was 3 years ago. jprimeon April 27, 2007   
Lyrics: Come and hold my hand; I wanna contact the living; Not sure I understand; This role I've been given; I sit and talk to God; And he just laughs at my plans; My head speaks a language; I don't understand; ; I just wanna feel real love; Feel the home that I live in; 'Cause I got too much life; Running through my veins; Going to waste; ; I don't wanna die; But I ain't keen on living either; Before I fall in love; I'm preparing to leave her; I scare myself to death; That's why I keep on running; Before I've arrived; I can see myself coming; ; I just wanna feel real love; Feel the home that I live in; 'Cause I got too much life; Running through my veins; Going to waste; And I need to feel real love and a life ever after; I cannot give it up; ; I just wanna feel real love; Feel the home that I live in; I got too much love; Running through my veins; To go to waste; I just wanna feel real love in a life ever after; There's a hole in my soul; You can see it in my face; It's a real big place; ; Come and hold my hand; I wanna contact the living; Not sure I understand; This role I've been given; Not sure I understand; Not sure I understand; Not sure I understand; Not sure I understand
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who has no idea what he's doing. He wants to contact the living, but he doesn't know what to do with his life. He doesn't want to die but he ain't keen on living either. He's not ready to live his life to the fullest, so he has to leave his wife. He is afraid of dying. He has too much life running through his veins to go to waste. He knows he needs to end his life before he dies, and he knows it's going to be a waste of his life, but it's not going to happen. He just wants to feel real love and a life ever after.
Ground Truth: what can i say? Robbie was on an off-key downer, all us drug users get them after significantly heavy usage. This song expresses his thoughts and feelings at the time and also some more longer-term deep emotional problems. i connected with this song when i had bad drug-induced business and it helped me out for bare.

Lyrics: Was it you who spoke the words that; Things would happen but not to me; Oh things are gonna happen naturally; Oh taking your advice and I'm; Looking on the bright side; And balancing the whole thing; ; Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines; And the bright light turns to night; Oh until the dawn it brings; Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me; ; 'Cause you and I both loved; What you and I spoke of; And others just read of; Others only read of the love; Oh the love that I love, yeah; ; See I'm all about them words; Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words; Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words; More words than I had ever heard and I; Feel so alive; ; 'Cause you and I both loved; What you and I spoke of; And others just read of; And if you could see me now; Oh love oh; ; You and I you and I; Not so little you and I any more; And with this silence brings a moral story more importantly evolving; Is the glory of a boy; ; 'Cause you and I both loved; What you and I spoke of; And others just read of; And if you could see me now; Well then I'm almost finally out of; ; I'm finally out of; Finally de de de de de de de; Well I'm almost finally, finally; Well I am free, oh I'm free; ; And it's okay if you had to go away; Oh just remember the telephones; Well they're working in both ways; But if I never, ever hear them ring; ; If nothing else I'll think the bells inside; Have finally found you someone else; And that's okay; 'Cause I'll remember everything you sang; ; 'Cause you and I both loved; What you and I spoke of; And others just read of; And if you could see me now; Well then I'm almost finally out of; I'm finally out of; Finally de de de de de de de de; Well I'm almost finally, finally; Out of words
Sample outputs: This song is amazing. It's one of my favorite songs of all time. I agree that it's about a guy who's fallen in love with a girl, but he doesn't know how to tell her. He's telling her he's not going to let her go, but that he'll always love her, no matter what. He wants her to know that he still loves her, and that he's willing to do anything to get her back, even if it means he's going to have to leave her. I love the line "If nothing else I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else." It's so beautiful. I've been listening to this song over and over again, and every time I hear it, I think of my ex-boyfriend, and it reminds me of him. I'm not a huge fan of this song, but it's definitely one of the best songs I've ever heard. It makes me cry everytime I listen to it.
Ground Truth: Tee hee, I watched a performance of this on jasonmraz.com and before he sang it, he said that it's about a girl who had left her lover/boyfriend in his bed to make him eggs, but when he woke up, he thought she had left him, so he wrote it from that perspective. greyeyeson March 06, 2003   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: It's our time to shine, through the down; Glorified by what is ours; We've fallen in love; We've fallen in love; It was the best idea I ever had!; ; Today I fell and felt better; Just knowing this matters; I just feel stronger and sharper!; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful; ; Today I fell and felt better!; Just knowing this matters!; I just feel stronger and sharper!; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful thing!; ; Today I fell and felt better; Just knowing this matters; I just feel stronger and sharper!; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful thing!; Sick!; ; Do you want a song of glory?; Well I'm fucking screaming, at you!; ; It's our time to shine, through the down; Glorified by what is ours; We've fallen in love; We've fallen in love; It was the best idea I ever had!; ; Today I fell and felt better; Just knowing this matters; I just feel stronger and sharper!; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful...; ; Today I fell and felt better; Just knowing this matters; I just feel stronger and sharper!; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful.; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful...; Found a box of sharp objects; What a beautiful thing!
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who has fallen in love with a girl and he wants to be with her again. "Today I fell and felt betterJust knowing this mattersI just feel stronger and sharperFound a box of sharp objectsWhat a beautiful thing"He's telling her how much he loves her and how much she means to him. "It was the best idea I ever had"He wants to tell her how he feels about her, and how he doesn't care what anyone else thinks about him, because he's happy with her.
Ground Truth: "That song, for me, is about drugs and alcohol and loss and love," rambledMcCracken. "It's about being proud of who you are, being proud of yoursituation and just being stoked that things are always going to get betteror always gonna get worse and that's such a great thing. Every day is a newsurprise." The single was inspired mostly by the singer's drug experiences, whichranged from being arrested for being high and trying to buy alcohol afterhours to watching one of his peers destroyed by the substances he himselfwas so reliant on. "One of my ex-girlfriend's really good friends passed away of a drug overdose, and that was kind of crazy at the time 'cause we were all out of our minds." Lots of hedonistic rockers get hooked on drugs after they join a touring rock band, but the camaraderie of being in the Used has had a calming effect on McCracken. "For a long time I was really off the deep end using needles," he said. "But all these guys are clean and sober and they're good guys, and they've helped me out a lot. ... I don't think it would have worked out if it hadn't been these guys." verihon August 24, 2016

Lyrics: Imagine you were at my station and you brought your motor to me; You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car; Said you wanna get your order filled, made me shiver when I put it in; Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you; ; Whoever thought you'd be better at turning a screw than me?; I do it for my life; Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge; Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeah yeah!; ; We were shifting hard when we took off put tonight all four on the floor; When we hit top end, you know it feels too slow; Said you wanna get your order filled, made me shiver when I put it in; Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you; ; Whoever thought you'd be better at turning a screw than me?; I do it for my life; Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge; Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeah yeah!; ; I'm giving you my room service and you know it's more than enough; Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love; Said you wanna get your order filled, made me shiver when I put it in; Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you; ; Whoever thought you'd be better at turning a screw than me?; I do it for my life, fuck yeah!; Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge; Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeah yeah!; ; Yeah!
Sample outputs: I like both bands a lot, exactly because they're not that similar. They're not exactly alike, but they're still very similar. As for the song, I think the main riff is better at the faster tempo, and think the Hetfield's vocals are better for his lyrics, and Mustaine's are better at his. I like the subject matter and overall writing of the lyrics better in the Metallica version, and I prefer the overall writing and writing style of the Mechanix version better. I don't think the lyrics should be taken too literally, just because they don't have the same amount of thought and writing. Everyone should be entitled to their own opinion on the music, and arguing about sucks more is stupid. Everyone has their own opinions on what the song should be about, and that's what I like about the song. I think everyone should have a different opinion on how the music should be played, and what should be done about it. If you want to argue about a song that's better for you, then you should argue with me. I'm not saying that everyone should be arguing about what the songs should be, I just think that arguing about the lyrics is stupid and stupid. And arguing over sucks more than arguing over a song sucks is stupid, and everyone should just shut the fuck up and just stop arguing over it. And if you don't like the song then don't bother arguing about it, because that's your own opinion, not everyone else's. Also, don't argue over a band's music, because you're entitled to your opinion, and you shouldn't argue about what everyone else thinks. I just wanted to point out that I'm a huge fan of Megadeth, and all of their songs are great, but I just don't agree with the majority of their music. I do like the idea of arguing over the lyrics and stuff, but arguing over what they should be doesn't make the arguing any less pointless. It's a great song, and the lyrics aren't all that bad. I love the way the lyrics are written and the music is good, but the music itself isn't as good as the lyrics. And that's the beauty of music, it doesn't have to be about the same thing over and over again. It can be about a variety of things, but that's just my opinion.
Ground Truth: I like both bands a lot, exactly because they're not that similar. And all that stuff happened years ago. They grew up and got over it, so that might be a good idea for everyone else arguing about it. As for the song, I think the main riff is better at the faster tempo, and think the Hetfield's vocals are better for his lyrics, and Mustaine's are better for his. I do like the subject matter and overall writing of the lyrics better in the Metallica version, just because I find it more interesting. Everyone should be entitled to their own opinion on the music, and arguing about sucks more is stupid. chrissmitheadgon January 24, 2010   
Lyrics: I wish I could eat the salt; Off of your lost faded lips; We can cap the old times; Make playing only logical harm; We can cap the old lines; Make playing that nothing else will change; ; But she can read, she can read, she can read; She can read she's bad; She can read, she can read; She can read she's bad; Oh, she's bad; ; But it's different now that I'm poor and aging; I'll never see this face again; You go stabbing yourself in the neck; ; And we could find new ways of living; Make playing only logical harm; And we could top the old times; Clay-making that nothing else will change; ; But she can read, she can read, she can read; She can read she's bad; She can read, she can read; She can read she's bad; Oh, she's bad; ; It's different now that I'm poor and aging; I'll never see this place again; You go stabbing yourself in the neck; But it's different now that I'm poor and aging; I'll never see this place again; And you'll go stabbing yourself in the neck; ; It's in the way that she poses; It's in the things that she puts in my hair; Her stories are boring and stuff; She's always calling my bluff; She puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart; And she gets in my room and she takes it apart; She puts the weights into my little heart; I said she puts the weights into my little heart; She packs it away; It's in the way that she walks; Her heaven is never enough; She puts the weights in my heart; She puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who's in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him because she thinks that he's not good enough for her, and he's trying to convince himself that she's not bad enough for him, but he can't stop thinking about her. I think the "she puts the weights into my little heart" part is him telling himself that he'll never see her again, and that she'll never be the same again, because he won't be able to handle her again. I don't know, that's just my take on it.
Ground Truth: the song might me about breaking up....the first verse which actually introduces the whole song "i wish i could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips" is about regretting something like "i wish you would take back all the nasty things you said to me" OR "i wish your lips hadn't had a bitter taste the last time i kissed you"....then "we can cap the old times...." confirms the fact that the lyrics are about a lost love that he regrets..."she can read....she's bad" means that she knows how much he suffers and she does nothing about it because she doesn't really care...in the verse "but it's different now.....poor and aging" he talks about the time that passed between them and there's nothing else that she can do to fix the damage she had caused..."you'll go stabbing yourself......" it's her turn now to regret and suffer....the lyrics are written in a way so that listeners can understand the meaning in different ways : some think that the song is about something that didn't actually happen , a love that didn't work , and to be honest ,this version works for me , as i feel much more related to the lyrics which have this meaning...FoxyCleopatraon June 30, 2007   
Lyrics: If I see the morning hours; I'll have one more yesterday; Take life from tomorrow; 'Cause I've burned out my today; ; If I get up to the top I know; I'll just go back downhill; I've gotta terminal future; And it's time to write my will; ; Ah, down another glass of courage; And a shot of Thorazine; ; We're not ready to see you yet; 99 ways to die; We're not ready to see you yet; ; Got a short between the earphones; Wringing my hands in dismay; A more efficient maniac; With two feet in the grave; ; Ain't got no last words to say; Yellow streak right up my spine; The gun in my mouth was real; And the taste blew my mind; ; In a black tie and straight jacket; Man, I'm gonna try again; ; We're not ready to see you yet; 99 ways to die; We're not ready to see you yet; ; We're not ready to see you yet; 99 ways to die; We're not ready to see you yet; ; We'll have demitasse of arsenic; Try on this tie; Never mind the tree; ; There is only death and danger; In the socket of my eyes; A playground of illusion; No one plays, they only die; ; There's a prison in my mind; And the bars are gonna break; I'm as mad as a hatter; And strung out just the same; ; Taunting rigor Mortis; I feel it draw me in; ; We're not ready to see you yet; 99 ways to die; We're not ready to see you yet; ; We're not ready to see you yet; 99 ways to die; We're not ready to see you yet; ; We're not ready; We're not ready; We're not ready; 99, 99
Sample outputs: I think this song is about someone who is trying to convince himself that he's not ready to live his life the way he wants to, and that he doesn't want to live in this world. I think he's saying that he can't live this way, so he's going to do what he wants, no matter what, and he's just going to go back to the way it was when he was younger. I don't know, maybe that's just me, but that's what I think.
Ground Truth: The song was originally written about suicide and feeling as if his life is getting worse day to day, with no positive things in sight. Rumor has it that the chorus was originally "they're not ready to see me yet", meaning that God and/or Satan didn't want him to die yet. Mustaine did attempt suicide around the time this song was made, and he did die for a few minutes before being brought back. The lyrics were obviously negative and dealt with subjects that Megadeth knew wouldn't be allowed on Mtv, so they made the video with anti-gun messages and scenes of children playing with guns. This was to make the video seem as if the song was "uplifting" in a way. GhostOfWaron June 03, 2002   
Lyrics: I need an easy friend; I do with an ear to lend; I do think you fit this shoe; I do but you have a clue; ; I'll take advantage while; You hang me out to dry; But I can't see you every night; Free; I do; ; I'm standing in your line; I do hope you have the time; I do pick a number two; I do keep a date with you; ; I'll take advantage while; You hang me out to dry; But I can't see you every night; Free; I do; ; I need an easy friend; I do with an ear to lend; I do think you fit this shoe; I do but you have a clue; ; I'll take advantage while; You hang me out to dry; But I can't see you every night; No I can't see you every night; Free; I do; I do; I do; I do
Sample outputs: I think that this song is about someone who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him because he doesn't know what to do with her. "I need an easy friendI do with an ear to lendI do think you fit this shoeI do but you have a clueI'll take advantage whileYou hang me out to dryBut I can't see you every nightFor freeI do"I think this is about a guy who is trying to convince a girl that he likes her, but he can't tell her how he feels about her because he's not sure if she likes him or not, and he's trying to tell her that he loves her and wants to be friends with her, even though he knows that she isn't the right person for him. I'm standing in your lineI do hope you have the timeI do pick a number twoI do keep a date with you"This is about the guy trying to get her to like him, but the girl doesn't feel the same way about him as he does about her. He's telling her that she needs to "keep a date" with him, and that he's hoping that she'll have time to see him every night for free. I think that's what the song means to me, because that's exactly what I'm going through right now.
Ground Truth: kurt wrote some of the songs for hole albums. he even sung back up on time. anywhos, ya like everyone said its about tracy threating to throw him out because he didnt have a job, after listening to the beatles. great song. nirvana_honey13on January 08, 2006   
Lyrics: Hello; Is there anybody in there; Just nod if you can hear me; Is there anyone at home; Come on now; I hear you're feeling down; And I can ease your pain; Get you on your feet again; Relax; I'll need some information first; Just the basic facts; Can you show me where it hurts; ; There is no pain, you are receding; A distant ship smoke on the horizon; You are only coming through in waves; Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying; When I was a child I had a fever; My hands felt just like two balloons; Now I've got that feeling once again; I can't explain, you would not understand; This is not how I am; I have become comfortably numb; ; I have become comfortably numb; ; O.K.; Just a little pin prick; There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!; But you may feel a little sick; Now can you stand up?; I do believe it's working, good; That'll keep you going through the show; Come on it's time to go; ; There is no pain, you are receding; A distant ship smoke on the horizon; You are only coming through in waves; Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying; When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse; Out of the corner of my eye; I turned to look but it was gone; I cannot put my finger on it now; The child is grown, the dream is gone; And I have become comfortably numb
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who has been in a drug induced state of mind for a long time, and when they finally get out of it, they realize that they have become comfortably numb to reality, and they feel like they have lost all sense of purpose and purpose in their life. "When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpseOut of the corner of my eyeI turned to look but it was goneI cannot put my finger on it nowThe child is grownThe dream is goneAnd I have becomeComfortably Numb"This is my favorite part of the song. I think it's about someone who is in a state of depression, and is trying to cope with it, but can't help but feel like there is no way out. The line "I can't explain, you would not understandThis is not how I am" is about how the person has become numb to the reality of the world, and how he can't understand why he is in this state, and that he has lost all meaning in his life, which is why he has become "comfortably numb".
Ground Truth: this song is definitely about heroin use....anyone who has seen the wall will know for sure...other interpretations can be made though.....im a medical student so i think i have a fair idea what hes talking abt.......heroin is a powerful opiate which blocks opioid receptors and in additionn to the mindblowing high numbs sensations mainly pain......pink has obviously overdosed on heroin......the whole song is like a doctor patient conversation.......the shot that is given to pink makes him cry out loud....it is the antidote to opiate poisoning ...naloxone...on injection it stops the blockage of opiate receptors and results in severe pain.......no question about it....its about heroin use....canopeneron October 25, 2008

Lyrics: Walk out into velvet; Nothing more to say; You're my favourite moment; You're my Saturday; ; Cos you're my Number 1; I'm like a dog to get you; I want it up and on; I'm like a dog to get you; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; ; Sunset only seconds; Just ripe then it's gone; Got no new intentions; Just right then it's gone; ; Cos you're my Number 1; I'm like a dog to get you; I want it up and on; I'm like a dog to get you; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; ; I'll be there to meet you; Getting down to greet you; ; Walk out into velvet; Nothing more to say; You're my favourite moment; You're my Saturday; ; Cos you're my Number 1; I'm like a dog to get you; I want it up and on; I'm like a dog to get you; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; ; Cos you're my Number 1; I'm like a dog to get you; I want it up and on; I'm like a dog to get you; ; Howl under the moon; Howl under the moon; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; Howl under the moon; Howl under the moon
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who's in love with a girl, but she doesn't love him back. "Walk out into velvet, nothing more to say, you're my favourite moment. You're my Saturday"He's like a dog to get her, he wants to be with her. "Sunset only seconds, just ripe then it's gone, got no new intentions, just right then its gone"He knows she's the one, but he doesn't want her to know it. "I'll be there to meet you, getting down to greet you"He wants her to be there for him when he's ready to give her a chance. "You're my number 1, I'm like a Dog to get you, I want it up and on"She's just waiting for him to come back, and he'll be "there" to greet her.
Ground Truth: not every song is about drugs. some! but not all. this is about her One 'n' Only. like a dog to get you... dogs have something to lead them to where they're headed. allison has her music, she'll reach her love. we all have our own leads. pixieinpanoplyon June 20, 2008   
Lyrics: I am an arms dealer fitting you with weapons in the form of words; And (don't really care which side wins); As long as the room keeps singing that's just the business I'm in; ; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress; ; I'm a leading man; And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,; oh so intricate; I'm a leading man; And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,; oh so intricate; ; I wrote the gospel on giving up; (You look pretty sinking); But the real bombshells have already sunk (prima-donnas of the gutter); At night we're painting your trash gold, while you sleep; Crashing not like hips or cars but more like p-p-p-parties; ; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; Bandwagon's full, please catch another; ; I'm a leading man; And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,; oh so intricate; I'm a leading man; And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,; oh so intricate; ; All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love; And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough; Sing, until your lungs give out; ; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; (Now You); This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; (Wear Out The Groove); This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; (Sing Out Loud); This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; (Oh, oh); This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race; ; I'm a leading man; And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,; oh so intricate; I'm a leading man; And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,; oh so intricate
Sample outputs: This song is about the music scene in the UK. It's about the scene in general, and how they are becoming more and more popular. "Bandwagon's full, please catch another" is about how the scene is getting more popular, and they are getting more fans. "I am an arms dealer fitting you with weapons in the form of wordsAnd (don't really care which side wins)As long as the room keeps singing that's just the business I'm in"This is saying that they are making money off of the scene, and that they don't care if they are popular or not. They are just making money because they want to be popular. I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress"I think this means that they aren't going to give up on the scene. They're going to keep making music because they love it. "All the boys who the dancefloor didn't loveAnd all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enoughSing, until your lungs give out"This shows that they're making money out of it, but they're not going to do it because they know that they can't sell out. "You look pretty sinkingBut the real bombshells have already sunk (prima-donnas of the gutter)At night we're painting your trash gold, while you sleepCrashing not like hips or cars but more like p-p-pparties"I'm not sure what this means, but it sounds like they are saying that the scene isn't getting any better, so they're just going to get more fans, and then they'll have to move on. I think this is a really good song, and I love Fall Out Boy. I can't wait to see them in concert. This song is so catchy, and it's my favorite on the album. I love the lyrics, and the music video too. I just love the video. I don't know what the song's about, but that's what I think it means to me.
Ground Truth: i remember when we used to pop in a CD and if we thought it sounded good we bobbed our heads and if the heads werent bobbin we threw the fucker out and tried a new CDlets leave music at what it issounds that go in yer fuckin ear and u either like them or you dont its that simpleDoctaPhilon February 05, 2007   
Lyrics: The piercing radiant moon; The storming of poor June; All the life running through her hair; Approaching guiding light; Our shallow years in fright; Dreams are made, winding through my head; Through my head; Before, you know, awake; Your lives are open wide; The V-chip gives them sight; Of all the life running through her hair; The spiders all in tune; The evening of the moon; Dreams are made, winding through my head; Through my head; Before, you know, awake; Through my head, through my head; Before; You know; Before, you know; I will be waiting, all awake; Dreams are made, winding through her hair; Dreams are made, winding through her hair
Sample outputs: This song is about the v-chip implanted into our brain. The V-chip gives them sightOf all the life running through her hairThe spiders all in tuneThe evening of the moonDreams are made winding through my headBefore you know, awakeYour lives are open wideThe V-chips give them sight of all the lives running through HER hairThe spider all in tunesThe evening on the moonThe spiders are in tuneThey are the spiders that control our lives. The spiders are the people who control our minds. The v-chipped is the people that control us. The spider is the person that controls our minds and we are the ones that control the spiders. It is the spiders who control us and the spiders are our souls. They control our thoughts and our dreams. They are the spider that controls us and controls our lives, our lives and our lives in general.
Ground Truth: I for sure get the impression that this song is about surveillance. It seems to be about the "V-chip" in general. The "spiders" are probably the "V-chips" themselves while. "Her hair" could be the network itself. As far as "poor june", I am at a complete loss on that one. Justashadowon April 12, 2002   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Holding back the year; Thinking of the fear I've had so long; When somebody hears; Listen to the fear that's gone; Strangled by the wishes of pater; Hoping for the arms of mater; Get to neither sooner or later; Oh-oh-oh; Holding back the years; Chance for me escape from all I know; Holding back the tears; Cause nothing here has grown; I've wasted all my tears; Wasted all those years; Nothing had the chance to be good; Nothing ever could y-e-a-h; Oh-oh-oh; I'll keep holding on; I'll keep holding on; I'll keep holding on; I'll keep holding on; So tired; Alright oh now; Well I've wasted all my tears; Wasted all those years; And nothing had the chance to be good; Cause nothing ever could; Oh yeah oh; I'll keep holding on; I'll keep holding on; I'll keep holding on; I'll keep holding on; Holding holding holding; A-a-a-h... va-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la; I said ooh yeah; That's all I have today; It's all I have to say; That's all I have today; It's all I have to say
Sample outputs: This song is about holding on to the past and not being able to let go. "Holding back the yearThinking of the fear I've had so longWhen somebody hearsListen to the fear that's goneStrangled by the wishes of paterHoping for the arms of materGet to neither sooner or later"I think this is talking about the fear of the future and how the past has become too much for him to handle, and how he has wasted his life trying to get out of it. He's trying to convince himself that he's not going to give up, but he knows that it's going to be hard. "I'll keep holding onSo tiredAlright oh nowWell I've wasted all my tearsWasted all those yearsAnd nothing had the chance to be goodCause nothing ever couldOh yeah oh I'll keep holdin'Holding holding holdingHolding holdin holdin 'holdin'I said ooh yeahThat's all I have todayIt's all that I have to say"He's saying that the past is all he has to say, and that he'll keep on holding on, because it's all he can say. I love this song.
Ground Truth: Song FactMick said at the recent 30th anniversary concert he wrote this song when he was sixteen at his father's house, in his 'little room'. The three chords he knew! He started playing acoustic, then he incorporated the full band halfway though the song. Go see them live if you can, it was so worth the money. coopdawhoopon March 01, 2016   
Lyrics: You're such an inspiration for the ways; That I will never ever chose to be; Oh so many ways for me to show you; How your savior has abandonned you; ; (Fuck your God); Your Lord, your Christ; (He did this); Took all you had and; (Left you this way); Still you pray, never stray, never; (Never taste of the fruit); Never thought to question why; ; It's not like you killed someone; It's not like you drove a hateful spear into His side; Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed; He did it all for you; He did it all for you; ; Oh so many ways for me to show you; How your dogma has abandonned you; ; (Pray); To your Christ, to your God; (Never taste of the fruit); Never stray, never break, never; (Choke on a lie); Even though he's the one; (Who did this to you); Never thought to question why; ; Not like you killed someone; It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into His side; Talk to Jesus Christ as if he knows the reasons why; He did it all for you; He did it all for you; Did it all for you
Sample outputs: This song is obviously about Maynard's mother, Judith Marie Keenan. His mother was paralyzed when she was paralyzed. The song is about how Maynard is angry at his mother for believing in a god who did this to her, and how he will never forgive her because he believes that he loves her so much. The line "It's not like you killed someoneIt's Not like you drove a hateful spear into his sidePraise the one who left you broken down and paralyzedHe did it all for you" is a reference to his mother's death. He is angry that his mother died and he is angry because he doesn't understand why he did it to her. The last line of the song is referring to how his mother didn't believe in God, but he still loves her. It's a great song, and I can't wait for Maynard to come back to this site and tell us what it's about.
Ground Truth: YOUR ALL WRONG! This is about his mother when she was paralyzed. Check out the meaning of 10,000 days Wings for Marie. It's actually cool how he expressed his feelings when she was alive and the after she passed away. rmonireyon January 07, 2007

Lyrics: Sitting on a park bench; Eyeing little girls with bad intent; Snot's running down his nose; Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes; Hey, Aqualung; ; Drying in the cold sun; Watching as the frilly panties run; Hey, Aqualung; Feeling like a dead duck; Spitting out pieces of his broken luck; Oh, Aqualung; ; Sun streaking cold; An old man wandering lonely; Taking time the only way he knows; Leg hurting bad as he bends to pick a dog-end; Goes down to the bog and warms his feet; ; Feeling alone; The army's up the road; Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea; Aqualung, my friend; Don't you start away uneasy; You poor old sod; You see, it's only me; ; Do you still remember; December's foggy freeze; When the ice that clings on to your beard; Was screaming agony; And you snatch your rattling last breaths; With deep-sea diver sounds; And the flowers bloom; Like madness in the spring; ; Sun streaking cold; An old man wandering lonely; Taking time the only way he knows; Leg hurting bad as he bends to pick a dog-end; He goes down to the bog; And warms his feet; Woh-o-o-oh; ; Feeling alone; The army's up the road; Salvation a la mode and a cup of tea; Aqualung, my friend; Don't you start away uneasy; You poor old sod; You see, it's only me; Me-ee-eeh, o-o-o-oh; ; Dee dee dee dee; Dee dee, dee dee, dee dee; Dee dee dee, dee dee dee; Dee dee, dee dee; ; Aqualung, my friend; Don't you start away uneasy; Oh, you poor old sod; You see, it's only me; ; Sitting on a park bench; Eyeing little girls with bad intent; Snot's running down his nose; Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes; Hey, Aqualung; ; Drying in the cold sun; Watching as the frilly panties run; Hey, Aqualung; Feeling like a dead duck; Spitting out pieces of his broken luck; Hey, Aqualung; ; Wo-o-o-o-oh, Aqualung
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who has been abandoned by his family. He feels like a dead duck, and he doesn't know how to get out of it. He's not sure if he'll ever get out, but he wants to. "Do you still remember, December's foggy freezeWhen the ice that clings on to your beardWas screaming agonyAnd you snatch your rattling last breathsWith deep-sea diver soundsAnd the flowers bloomLike madness in the spring"I think that is a reference to the end of the world, when the ice clings to the beard, and the flowers blooming like madness in spring. I think it's about a guy who's been abandoned, and now he's begging for help from the people around him. He wants to be saved, but they don't seem to know what to do with him. I don't know, that's just what I think.
Ground Truth: Yes, a song about an indigent soul has made a rock legend. In fact the singer(who's FIRST wife who wrote the song) felt he had to instill even more meaning to it's simple theme of "a bum who dies" by portraying himself, Ian Anderson as the bum on stage or video. On stage he'd say things like "you poor ol sod you see it's only, a me......" A powerful image of the poor destitute homeless man woven throughout many of the bands commercial offerings. But you see, his FIRST wife made the song work to the teenage adolescent types with "snot is running down his nose, greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes...." At that time, snot was as bad as Slip Knot today. gaganthony1on May 27, 2002   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Hey hey hey, Mr. Hangman; Go get your rope; Your daughters weren't careful; I fear that I am a slippery slope; ; Now even if I lay my head down at night; After a day I got perfectly right; She won't know; She won't know; ; So play little player; You gotta contend; And you can't blame your mother; She's trying not to say I was the worst mistake; ; And I wish that I could tell you right now; I love you but it looks like I won't be around; So you won't know, you won't know; So you won't know, you won't know; ; So believe in me, believe them; You think I'll let you down, well, I won't; They can fire everything they've got; And what do you think? I'm sunk? I will float on and die; ; I am fine to put your gun to my life; And know I'm scared it won't fire right; You won't know, you won't know; You won't know, you won't know; ; You're never going to feel as full as you felt; So let's go outside and we'll play William Tell; Take your time drawing a bead, I'll stand as still as you need; 'Cause you're so good at talking smack, heart attack; But you're the apple of my eye anyway; ; The smile on your face, it's on your plate; It's on a silver plate; ; So they say, they say in heaven; There's no husbands and wives; On the day that I show up; They'll be completely out of their forgiveness supplies; ; And I can't use the telephone; To tell you that I'm dead and gone; So you won't know, you won't know; Yeah, you won't know, yeah, you won't know; Yeah, you won't know, yeah, you won't know; Yeah, you won't know, you won't know
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't love him back. He is trying to get her back, but he doesn't want her to know how much he loves her. He's telling her that he'll do anything for her, even if it means killing her. "You're never going to feel as full as you feltSo let's go outside and we'll play William TellTake your time drawing a beadI'll stand as still as you need'Cause you're so good at talking smack, heart attackBut you're the apple of my eye anywayThe smile on your face, it's on your plateIt's on a silver plateSo they say, they say in heavenThere's no husbands and wivesOn the day that I show upThey'll be completely out of their forgiveness suppliesAnd I can't use the telephoneTo tell you that I'm dead and goneSo you won't knowYou won'tknowYeah, You Won't knowYeah,You Won't KnowYeah, you Won'tknowYou won’t knowYou’re never gonna feel asfull as you feelSo let’s go outsideAnd we’ll playWilliam TellAnd take your timeDrawing a bead, I'll standAs still as I need'cause you're a good at talk smack,heart attackBut your the apple in my eye anyways"This is my favorite part of the song. I think it's about a girl who is so great at talking, and she's so good that she can't tell anyone. She's the apple on his eye anyway. It's on the silver plate. So they say they sayIn heaven there's no husband and wivesAnd on the day they show up, they'll becompletely outOf their forgiving supplies"This part is about the guy telling her how he feels about her, and how he's going to be there for her when she's ready to go. He can't talk to her, because he's afraid he'll hurt her, so he won't tell her. She won't even know that he's dead, because she's not ready to tell him. He won't be able to tell her that she's gone, and that he can't get over her. I love this song, and it's so beautiful. It makes me cry every time I hear it.

Lyrics: Then as it was, then again it will be; An' though the course may change sometimes; Rivers always reach the sea; Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays; On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey; Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow; But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go; ; Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me; In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be; ; Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad; Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had; Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good; 'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would; ; Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen; Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen; Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow; We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul; ; Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me; Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be; Oh darlin', oh darlin'; ; I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave; Holdin' on, ten years gone; Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a long-distance relationship. It's about a couple that's been together for a long time, but they've drifted apart. They've been apart for years, and it's hard to let go of each other. "Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with meIn the midst I think of you, and how it used to beDid you ever really need somebody, and really need 'em bad"I think it's about the fact that they're still together, and they're trying to figure out how to move on, but their relationship isn't going anywhere. "Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to meNever thought I'd see your face the way it used ot beOh, darlin', oh, darlingI'm never going to leave you, I never gonna leaveHoldin' on, ten years goneTen years gone, holding on, 10 years gone"I don't know what this means, but it's a beautiful song, and I love it.
Ground Truth: i cant decide between the rain song and ten years gone as my favorite song, both are unbelievable and packed with emotion that can't be found anywhere elseten years gone has been the story of my life as i have a huge problem with expressing my own emotions, i'll find a girl i really start to like but never have the balls to let her know, and this song especially hit me when i found out later one girl shared the same feelings i had for her but now it's too late because i didn't speak up, i use this song to help me imagine what could have beenswatson2133on June 30, 2008   
Lyrics: Walk with me, my little child; To the forest of denial; Speak with me, my only mind; Walk with me, until the time; And make the forest turn to wine; You take the legend for a fall; You saw the product; ; Why can't you see that you are my child; Why don't you know that you are my mind; Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you; Take this promise to the end of you; ; Walk with me, my little friend; Take this promise to the end; Speak with me, my only mind; Walk with me, until the end; And make the forest turn to sand; You take the legend for a fall; You saw the product; ; Why can't you see that you are my child; Why don't you know that you are my mind; Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you; Take this promise to the end of you; ; Take this promise for a ride; You saw the forest, now come inside; You took the legend for its fall; You saw the product of it all; No televisions in the air; No circumcisions on the chair; You made the weapons for us all; Just look at us now; Why can't you see that you are my child; Why don't you know that you are my mind; Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you; Take this promise to the end of you
Sample outputs: I think this song is about the world we live in today. We live in a world of denial. We don't know how to deal with the world. We have no televisions in the air. No circumcisions on the chair. You made the weapons for us all. Just look at us now. I think this is about how the world is corrupting the way we live our lives. We make the weapons of our own destruction. "Why can't you see that you are my child? Why don't you know that you, are my mind? Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you. Take this promise to the end of you." This is the most powerful part of the song. I believe it is talking about how we are so blind to the world that we don't even know what we are doing to ourselves. "Take this promise for a ride, you saw the forest now come inside. You took the legend for its fall. You saw the product of it all." This part is referring to the use of televisions and television as a way to show the world how corrupt the world really is. "No televisions, in air, no circumciisions on a chair" This is saying that we can't see how corrupt our world is. We can't even see the world as it is today. "You made weapons of us all, just look at our now." I think that this part is saying how we made the world so corrupt that we are not even aware of what is happening to us. This is just my opinion.
Ground Truth: This song is about how humanity is a race whose roots are in the wilderness. We evolved from apes and many of our needs for happiness and fulfillment are based around very primitive goals. In the song the Personification of the forest is calling out to humanity to try and tell them that they will always be slaves to primitive nature until they accept it. SourSkinon May 31, 2009   
Lyrics: I guess you don't need it; I guess you don't want me to repeat it; But everything I have to give I'll give to you; It's not like we planned it; ; You tried to stay, but you could not stand it; To see me shut down slow as though; It was an easy thing to do; Listen when all of this around us will fall over; I tell you what we're gonna do; ; Hey; You will shelter me, my love; And I, I will shelter you, oh; I will shelter you; ; I left you heartbroken; But not until those very words were spoken; Has anybody ever made such a fool outta you; It's hard to believe it; ; Even as my eyes do see it; The very things that made you live, they're killing you; Listen when all of this around us will fall over; I tell you what we're gonna do; ; Hey; You will shelter me, my love; And I, I will shelter you; I will shelter you; ; I will shelter you; I will shelter you; I will shelter you; ; Listen when all of this around us will fall over; I tell you what we're gonna do; Hey; You will shelter me my love; ; And I, I will shelter you; If you shelter me, too; I will shelter you; I will shelter you
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a relationship where the person is trying to convince the other person that it's going to work out. "I guess you don't need it, I guess you dont want me to repeat itBut everything I have to give I'll give to youIt's not like we planned itYou tried to stay, but you could not stand itTo see me shut down slow as thoughIt was an easy thing to doListen when all of this around us will fall overI tell you what we're gonna doHey, you will shelter me, my loveAnd I, I will shelter youOh, I'll shelter youI left you heartbroken,But not until those very words were spokenHas anybody ever made such a fool outta you? It's hard to believe itEven as my eyes do see itThe very things that made you live, they're killing you"The person is telling the other that they don't know what to do, and that they can't be together, because they're afraid of what will happen to them, and they're scared of what might happen to their relationship. The person in the song is telling them that they are going to be together no matter what happens to them.
Ground Truth: Regardless of the meaning Ray intended it for, this will be my wedding song. Promising to shelter one another for the rest of each other's lives during our first close embrace together as man and wife through this song...I can't think of a more perfect memory. glxyjoneson March 28, 2007

Lyrics: What do I got to do to make you love me?; What do I got to do to make you care?; What do I do when lightning strikes me?; And awake to find that you're not there; What do I do to make you want me?; What do I got to do to be heard?; What do I say when it's all over?; Sorry seems to be the hardest word; It's sad (so sad) so sad; It's a sad sad situation; And it's getting more and more absurd; It's sad (so sad) so sad; Why can't we talk it over?; Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word; It's sad (so sad) so sad; It's a sad sad situation; And it's getting more and more absurd; It's sad (so sad) so sad; Why can't we talk it over?; Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word; What do I do to make you love me?; Oh-oh-oh; What do I got to do to be heard?; What do I do when lightning strikes me?; What have I got to do?; What have I got to do?; When sorry seems to be the hardest word
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't love him back. He's trying to make her understand that he loves her, but he doesn't know how to make it work. He wants her to know that he does love her, and he knows that it's not going to work out. It's a sad sad situation and it's getting more and more absurd. It seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word to say.
Ground Truth: I listen to it quite often and every time I realize how much is hidden behind all this simplicity. You can't make someone love you, if he or she doesn't want it and you never know what, actually, to say when it's all over, and it gives you a pain to manage any word. And these sad situations get absurd so often. Karinchenon June 20, 2007   
Lyrics: Oh, place your hands on my hope; Run your fingers through my soul, oh oh, yes; And the way that I feel right now; Oh Lord, it may go; ; So place your hands on my hope; Run your fingers through my soul, alright I say; Oh, and the way that we feel right now; Oh Lord, it may go; ; Put your hands on, put your hands on, yeah; Put your hands on, put your hands on, yeah; Put your hands on, put your hands on, yeah; Put your hands on, put; ; You know you cannot hide from what's inside; You know you cannot hide from what's inside; So I ask of you to help me through; I ask of you this thing to do; ; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put; ; So lay me down for a while; Join my body with my mind, alright now; Oh, and I cried at the common one; For weeks after he died; ; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on; ; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on; ; 'Cause the way that we feel right now; Oh Lord, it may go away; ; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on; Put your hands on, put your hands on
Sample outputs: This song is about a man who is sick of being in a relationship with someone. He wants to be with that person, but he can't. He needs someone to help him through. He's asking for someone to put his hands on his soul and make him feel alive again. It's a beautiful song, and I love it. It makes me cry everytime I hear it.
Ground Truth: this song is actually about the death of Gary Stringers grandfather, or so i heard. i think he's asking God or maybe even his grandfather to help him through his grief, etc. i think he just wants to be released from his grief, or 'the way that [he] feels right now'. tunes841on August 31, 2008   
Lyrics: For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals; Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination; We learned to talk; ; There's a silence surrounding me; I can't seem to think straight; I'll sit in the corner; No one can bother me; I think I should speak now (Why won't you talk to me); I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me); My words won't come out right (What are you thinking); I feel like I'm drowning (What are you feeling); I'm feeling weak now (Why won't you talk to me); But I can't show my weakness (You never talk to me); I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking); Where do we go from here (What are you feeling)3; ; It doesn't have to be like this; All we need to do is; Make sure we keep talking; ; (Why won't you talk to me) I feel like I'm drowning; (You never talk to me) You know I can't breathe now; (What are you thinking) We're going nowhere; (What are you feeling) We're going nowhere; (Why won't you talk to me); (You never talk to me); (What are you thinking); (Where do we go from here); ; It doesn't have to be like this; All we need to do is; Make sure we keep talking
Sample outputs: I don't think it's about a relationship. I think it is about a person who is in a relationship with someone who doesn't talk to them anymore. They don't want to talk to anyone anymore, and they don't know what to do with themselves.
Ground Truth: I agree with MtterOFactItsAllDrk. This IS one of the worst Floyd songs ever, and I'm not saying that because I dislike post-Roger Waters Floyd. It's really, really bad. The lyrics no longer have spark. This was played by the Aussie Pink Floyd show when I went and saw them...And it was better then the real thing. For one thing, the female voices were better.

Lyrics: I need another story; Something to get off my chest; My life gets kinda boring; Need something that I can confess; 'Til all my sleeves are stained red; From all the truth that I've said; Come by it honestly I swear; Thought you saw me wink, no; I've been on the brink; ; So tell me what you want to hear; Something that will light those ears; I'm sick of all the insincere; So I'm gonna give all my secrets away; This time; Don't need another perfect lie; Don't care if critics ever jump in line; I'm gonna give all my secrets away; ; My God, amazing how we got this far; It's like we're chasing all those stars; Who's driving shiny big black cars; And every day I see the news; All the problems that we could solve; And when a situation rises; Just write it into an album; Send it straight to gold; But I don't really like my flow, no; ; So tell me what you want to hear; Something that will light those ears; I'm sick of all the insincere; So I'm gonna give all my secrets away; This time; Don't need another perfect lie; Don't care if critics ever jump in line; I'm gonna give all my secrets away; ; Ooh; Got no reason, got no shame; Got no family I can blame; Just don't let me disappear; I'ma tell you everything; ; So tell me what you want to hear; Something that'll light those ears; I'm sick of all the insincere; So I'm gonna give all my secrets away; This time; Don't need another perfect lie; Don't care if critics ever jump in line; I'm gonna give all my secrets away; So tell me what you want to hear; Something that'll light those ears; I'm sick of all the insincere; So I'm gonna give all my secrets away; This time; Don't need another perfect lie; Don't care if critics ever jump in line; I'm gonna give all my secrets away; ; All my secrets away; ; All my secrets away
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who is in love with someone but he doesn't want to tell anyone about it. he wants to tell them what he really feels. so he's gonna give all his secrets away. i think the line "my god, amazing how we got this far, it's like we're chasing all those stars, who's driving shiny big black cars, and every day I see the news, all the problems that we could solve, and when a situation rises, just write it into an album, send it straight to gold, but I don't really like my flow, no" means that he wants everyone to know that he loves them and that he's not going to let them know that. i love this song. it's one of my favorites off of the new album. it makes me cry everytime i hear it.
Ground Truth: I think this song is about how some person is bored of their life and want to be able to talk about something to make their life more interesting, or how they want more attention and so they do things that could endanger them, staining their sleeves red, so they keep saying the "perfect lines" and come up with great stories by making them true so that others will listen, anything that others would like to hear. However, this person gets sick of all the acting, all the insincerities, all the secrets because he feels like the lies are eating away who he is and he's losing himself so he wants to tell the truth because its so hard to keep up with his own lies. This person seems like a huge whiner who wants some kind of assurance to who he is, that he's not "everyone" so he ends up being insincerely, overly truthful in order to assure himself that he's not everyone else but eventually loses himself. daazninvazn131on February 23, 2011   
Lyrics: Maybe I need some rehab, or maybe just need some sleep; I've got a sick obsession, I'm seeing it in my dreams; I'm looking down every alley, I'm making those desperate calls; I'm staying up all night hoping, hitting my head against the wall; ; What you've got, boy, is hard to find; I think about it all the time; I'm all strung out, my heart is fried; I just can't get you off my mind; ; Because your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; I said your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; ; Won't listen to any advice, momma's telling me I should think twice; Better left to my own advice? I'm addicted, it's a crisis; My friends think I've gone crazy, my judgment's getting kinda hazy; My sleep is gonna be affected if I; keep it up like a lovesick crack head; ; What you got, boy, is hard to find; I think about it all the time (All the time); I'm all strung out, my heart is fried; I just can't get you off my mind; ; Because your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; I said your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; ; I don't care what people say; The rush is worth the price I pay; I get so high when you're with me; But crash and crave you when you leave; ; Hey, so I gotta question; Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?; Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?; Is my love your drug?; ; Your drug, uh, your drug; Uh, your drug, is my love your drug?; ; Because your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; I said your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; ; Because your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; I said your love, your love, your love is my drug; Your love, your love, your love; ; Hey, hey so; Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug; I like your beard
Sample outputs: I love this song. It's so catchy. I think it's about a girl who's in love with a guy who's addicted to drugs, but he doesn't know what to do about it. He doesn't care what people say, the rush is worth the price I pay. I get so high when you're with me, but crash and crave you when you leave. I love this part: Hey so I gotta questionDo you wanna have a slumber party in my basement? Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum? Is my love your drug?
Ground Truth: First I was like " yeah this is same old shit that tik tok was" but then I watched the music video and I dont know is it just me or why I think that this song is about her relationship with jesus, I mean the guy in music video looked just like jesus and in the end she says " I like your beard" I dont know, maybe this is just simple love song but I really hope it somehow relates to jesus. lolled123on August 03, 2010   Link2 Replies

Lyrics: Trying hard to speak and; Fighting with my weak hand; Driven to distraction; It's all part of the plan; When something is broken; And you try to fix it; Trying to repair it; Any way you can; ; I dive in at the deep end; You become my best friend; I wanna love you; But I don't know if I can; I know something is broken; And I'm trying to fix it; Trying to repair it; Any way I can; ; You and me are floating on a tidal wave; Together; You and me are drifting into outer space; And singing; ; You and me are floating on a tidal wave; Together; You and me are drifting into outer space; ; You and me are floating on a tidal wave; Together; You and me are drifting into outer space; And singing
Sample outputs: I love this song. I love the lyrics. I think it's about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't feel the same way about him, and he's trying to help her, but he can't do it because he doesn't want to hurt her. He wants to be with her but he just can't. He doesn't know if he can love her the way he loves her, or if he'll ever be able to love her. It's a beautiful song, and I love how it starts with "Trying hard to speak andFighting with my weak handDriven to distractionIt's all part of the planWhen something is brokenAnd you try to fix itTrying to repair itAny way you canI dive in at the deep endYou become my best friendI wanna love youBut I don't knowIf I canI know something's brokenAnd I'm trying to fixItTryingTo repairItAny way I canYou and me are floating on a tidal waveTogetherYou and us are driftingInto outer spaceAnd singing"This is my favorite part of this song, because it's so beautiful. It reminds me of a relationship I had with my ex-boyfriend, and how I felt about him when we first started dating. It was so beautiful, and it helped me so much. I wish I could be with him, but I can't, because he's always been there for me, and that's how I feel about him. He's my best guy friend and I can never stop loving him, even though I know it's not the right thing to do. I know I shouldn't, but it's what I feel like when I listen to it.
Ground Truth: This song can definitely be interpreted on a deep scale, but the subliminal message is the effect distance has on a person. Tidal waves are rough and unforetold as to where they may make their next current, just as the events in life are. When life gets you down, you're in an "X&Y", two different things trying to work for the best dispite the rough road between them. nazonatte69on June 06, 2005   
Lyrics: Lead to the river; Midsummer, I waved; A V of black swans on with hope to the grave; All through Red September; With skies fire-paved; I begged you appear like a thorn for the holy ones; Cold was my soul, untold was the pain; I faced when you left me a rose in the rain; So I swore to the razor; That never enchained would your dark nails of faith; Be pushed through my veins again; ; Bared on your tomb I'm a prayer for your loneliness; And would you ever soon come above unto me?; For once upon a time from the binds of your lowliness; I could always find the right slot for your sacred key; ; Six feet deep is the incision; In my heart, that barless prison; Discolours all with tunnel vision; Sunsetter; Nymphetamine; Sick and weak from my condition; This lust, this vampyric addiction; To her alone in full submission; None better; Nymphetamine; Nymphetamine, nymphetamine; Nymphetamine girl; Nymphetamine, nymphetamine; My nymphetamine girl; ; Wracked with your charm I am circled like prey; Back in the forest where whispers persuade; More sugar trails more white lady laid; Than pillars of salt; ; Fold to my arms hold their mesmeric sway; And dance out to the moon as we did in those golden days; Christening stars I remember the way; We were needle and spoon mislaid in the burning hay; ; Bared on your tomb I'm a prayer for your loneliness; And would you ever soon come above unto me?; For once upon a time from the bind of your holiness; I could always find the right slot for your sacred key; ; Six feet deep is the incision; In my heart, that barless prison; Discolours all with tunnel vision; Sunsetter; Nymphetamine; Sick and weak from my condition; This lust, this vampyric addiction; To her alone in full submission; None better; Nymphetamine; ; Sunsetter; Nymphetamine (nymphetamine); None better; Nymphetamine; Nymphetamine, nymphetamine; Nymphetamine girl; Nymphetamine, nymphetamine; My nymphetamine girl
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl who is not good for him, but he is addicted to her and wants to be with her. He wants her to come back to him because he loves her so much, but she can't. He can't find the right slot for her sacred key, so he keeps going back to her, hoping that she will return to him. He knows that she is a drug addict, and he knows that he can never get her back. But he can't stop thinking about her, and wishes that she would come back and be with him again. I don't know if this is right or not, but that's what I think it means. I think this is one of my favorite songs of all time. I can't wait for the new album to come out!
Ground Truth: Just to clarify: I called it "Sweet" - I know that's a weird term to use, given the grime darkness of the emotion. But I'm twisted. I like the other person that referred to the female as a succubus and he is submissive to the relationship. I still go with my interpretation that the male is literally dead in the poem and not just spiritually. This is more in style with Poe type works, where sometimes the literal story is quite abstract (dealing with taboo situations like death) but it's told to invoke or show a deeper emotion that you can take out of the context of the story.

Lyrics: Day by day,; Let's pave the path to escape.; Pave the way.; Tragic endings passed away.; Bring forth sincerity,; Bring forth the change.; This portrait of dishonesty will be slain.; ; I will not hold back.; I will not regret.; I won't hold back.; I won't regret.; ; This place I now call home is nothing more than a fallacy.; Nothing more than a fallacy...; This is not my home...; ; You got a one way ticket to hell,; With open arms to damnation.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been hurt so many times that he can't help but to think that he's going to go back to the way he used to be. I don't know if this is right or not but it's what I think it means to me. I'm not sure if it's right or wrong but that's how I see it. It's a beautiful song, and it's one of my favorites on the album.
Ground Truth: If any of you that are trying to explain this song had listened to the demo, you would know that this song is about Obama. On the demo the intro starts with a recording of Barrack Obama saying, "I'm Barrack Obama, and I aprove this message." This song is what B.O.O. believes will happen due to Obama's presidency.
Lyrics: The truth is that I never shook my shadow; Every day, it's trying to trick me into doing battle; Calling out 'faker', only get me rattled; Wanna pull me back behind the fence with the cattle; ; Building your lenses, digging your trenches; Put me on the front line, leave me with a dumb mind; With no defenses but your defense is; If you can't stand to feel the pain then you are senseless; ; Since this, I've grown up some different kind of fighter; And when the darkness comes, let it inside you; And your darkness is shining, my darkness is shining; Have faith in myself; Truth; ; I've seen a million numbered doors on the horizon; Now which is the future you're choosing before you go dying?; I'll tell you about a secret I've been undermining; Every little lie in this world comes from dividing; ; Say you're my lover, say you're my own, homie; Tilt my chin back, slit my throat; Take a bath in my blood, get to know me; All out of my secrets, all my enemies are turning into my teachers; ; Because light's blinding, no way dividing; What's yours or mine when everything's shining?; You darkness is shining, my darkness is shining; Have faith in ourselves; Truth; ; Yes, I'm only loving, only trying to only love; And, yes, and what I'm trying to do is only loving; Yes, I'm only loving, trying to only love; I swear to God, I'm only trying to be loving; ; Yes, I'm only lonely loving; Yes, I'm only feeling only loving, only loving; You say it ain't loving, ain't loving; Ain't loving, my loving; ; But I'm only loving, still only loving; Swear to god, I'm only loving; Trying to be loving, loving; Loving, loving, loving, loving; ; Yes I'm only loving, yes, trying to only love; I swear to god, I'm trying but I'm only loving; You say it ain't loving, ain't loving, ain't loving; Ain't loving, ain't loving my loving; But I'm only loving, loving, loving, loving the truth; ; Truth
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is trying to make the world a better place, but he/she doesn't know what to do with himself/herself. He/she is afraid of the world around him/her, and they don't know how to do anything about it, so they're "only loving" and "trying to be loving" instead of "loving" themselves. It's a very beautiful song, and one of my favorite songs of all time.
Ground Truth: I think the first line in the first chorus is "Sense this" rather than "Since this", as a play off of "senseless" from the previous line. frshon November 10, 2010   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: I'm your only friend; I'm not your only friend; But I'm a little glowing friend; But really I'm not actually your friend; But I am; ; Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch; Who watches over you; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; Not to put too fine a point on it; Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; ; I have a secret to tell; From my electrical well; It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells; So the room must listen to me; Filibuster vigilantly; My name is blue canary one note* spelled l-i-t-e; My story's infinite; Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest; ; Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch; Who watches over you; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; Not to put too fine a point on it; Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; ; I'm your only friend; I'm not your only friend; But I'm a little glowing friend; But really I'm not actually your friend; But I am; ; There's a picture opposite me; Of my primitive ancestry; Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free; Though I respect that a lot; I'd be fired if that were my job; After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts; Bluebird of friendliness; Like guardian angels its always near; ; Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch; Who watches over you; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; Not to put too fine a point on it; Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; ; (and while you're at it; Keep the nightlight on inside the; Birdhouse in your soul); ; Not to put too fine a point on it; Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; ; Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it); Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the); Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul); ; Not to put too fine a point on it; Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet; Make a little birdhouse in your soul; ; Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it); Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the); Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul); ; Not to put too fine a point on it; Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet; Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is in love with someone, but they don't want to be with them because they're afraid of what they might do to them. The person in the song is telling the person that they're not the only one, but that they are a good person, and that they will be there for them when they need them most. They want them to be happy, and they want to make a birdhouse in their soul. That's my take on it.
Ground Truth: I'm with Ed Quidry. In keeping with a loosely knitted theme on this record their "lite" or philosophy is questioning, right or wrong, some major assumptions and blindly accepted notions as alluded to in theme to flood and road movie for example. They're asking us to make some room for these ideas. Interestingly, the final word on the record is that we are in the driver's seats of our own destinies. Notice in the video the band is out of step with and above the protestors with "vision" that is artificial and generic. satvabodhion June 19, 2007

Lyrics: Please excuse me but I've got to ask; Are you only being nice; Because you want something; My fairytale arab princess; Be careful how you respond; Cause you might end up in this song; I never gave you an encouragement; And it's doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; ; The more you try to erase me; The more, the more; The more that I appear; Oh, the more, the more; The more you try the eraser; The more, the more; The more that you appear; ; You know the answer; So why do you ask?; I am only being nice; Because I want someone, something; You're like a kitten with a ball of wool; And it is doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; Doing me in; ; The more you try to erase me; The more, the more; The more that I appear; Oh, the more, the more; The more I try to erase you; The more, the more; The more that you appear; ; No you're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!; You're wrong!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who wants to be with a guy, but he doesn't want her. "Please excuse me but I've got to askAre you only being nice because you want something? My fairytale arab princessBe careful how you respond 'cause you might end up in this songI never gave you an encouragementAnd it's doing me in"He's saying that he never gave her an encouragement, because she doesn't really want him. "The more you try to erase meThe more, the moreThe more that I appear"He is saying that the more he tries to erase her from his mind, the harder it is to do so. "You know the answerSo why do you ask? I am only bein niceBecause I want someone, somethingYou're like a kitten with a ball of woolAnd it is doing me outDoin' me inDoing me out"He feels like he's being pushed around by this girl, but she won't let him in. "No you're wrong! You're wrong!" He feels like she's wrong because he's trying to get away from her, even though he knows she's right.
Ground Truth: I'm not ruling out that this song could be about politics. I'm just saying that your interpretation of this song requires big, distorted stretches of meaning. It's true that alot of the songs on The Eraser have political meanings, but that doesn't mean that EVERY song does. You cant just pigeon hole everything on the album into the same category because politics are a theme in a few -or even most- of the songs. In "Harrowdown Hill" and "And It Rained All Night" there is a direct connection between the lyrics and their meanings. Harrowdown Hill is the name of the place that David Kelly died. It can't be anymore blatent than that. You really have nothing to go on other than the fact that he says "Arab". Everything else is completley indirect and could be interpreted many other ways without having to reach so much. Thats why I used Queen as an example: to show that by your way of interpreting songs, anything could be about terrorism or the Middle East. black_cow_of_deathon September 18, 2006   
Lyrics: On the way to your brother's house in the valley, dear,; By the river bridge a cradle floating beside me.; In the whitest water on the banks against the stone; You will lift his body from the shore and bring him home; ; Oliver James washed in the rain no longer; Oliver James washed in the rain no longer; ; On the kitchen table that your grandfather did make; You and your delicate way will slowly clean his fate; And you will remember when you rehearsed the actions of; A innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love; ; Oliver James washed in the rain no longer; Oliver James washed in the rain no longer; ; Walk with me down the beach and through the valley floor; Love for the one you know more; Love for the one you know more; ; Back we go to your brother's house emptier my dear; The sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear; ; Oliver James washed in the rain no longer; Oliver James washed in the rain no longer
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a young girl who has lost a loved one and is searching for the love of her life. The narrator is looking for her, and is trying to convince her that she has found the love that she needs to find. "On the kitchen table that your grandfather did makeYou and your delicate way will slowly clean his fateAnd you will remember when you rehearsed the actions ofA innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love"The narrator is telling her that even though she has lost her loved one, she will remember what she has done and what she did to make her life better. "Walk with me down the beach and through the valley floorLove for the one you know more"This is a beautiful part of the song. I think it is about the loss of someone you love very much and how much you love them, and how you wish you could have them back. "Back we go to your brother's house emptier my dearThe sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear"This part is so beautiful. I love it so much. I'm not sure if it's about a lost loved one or a lost child, but it's a beautiful song.
Ground Truth: "On the way to your brother's house in the valley, dear,"Song's protagonist & a woman (his wife or lover we assume b/c of later lines about motherhood) walk to her brother's house. They find a cradle in the river, the child inside is dead (larger context of the song suggests the child is dead). The woman takes the child home, the song's protagonist looks on as she washes him. "you will remember when you rehearse the actions ofAn innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love"Possible that the woman has lost a baby in the past (i.e. miscarriage or ), there are quite a few allusions to loss and the past throughout the song, and the woman is not merely carrying out the action of bathing the child, she's 'rehearsing', another indication the child is dead, and her act of lovingly bathing the child alludes to i) that the child was once alive, ii) that the woman is performing the role of mother, acting out the part, there's a sense of a double reality, that the child is dead yet her actions are as if it were alive, and the double reality of her having once cared for a child in the past. She 'remembers' these actions from the past, and an innocence from the past (her first child--also the innocence of Oliver James, the baby that has died)That the baby, Oliver James, was washed in the rain, and found in a cradle in the river, seems to suggest he didn't fall into the river, he was sent floating down the river. The contrast between neglect that led to the death of the child, left to the elements, is symbolized by the rain washing him, VS the maternal care of this woman, who washes him by hand, as love, as a mother. "Walk with me down Ruby beach and through the valley floorLove for the one you know more"I'm confused by this line 'love for the one you know more', it sounds almost like the writer wanted the pun / double meaning in the limited syllables of: 'love for the one you know NO more", i.e., love for someone who has died. "Back we go to your brother's house emptier my dearThe sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon 
Lyrics: The cash machine; Is blue and green; For a hundred in 20's; And a small service fee; I could spend three dollars; And 63 cents; On diet Coca-Cola; And unlit cigarettes; ; I wonder why; We listen to poets; When nobody gives a fuck; How hot and sorrowful; This machine begs for luck; All my lies are always wishes; ; I know I would die; If I could come back new; ; I want a good life; With a nose for things; A fresh wind and bright sky; To enjoy my suffering; A hole without a key; If I break my tongue; Speaking of tomorrow; How will it ever come; All my lies are always my wishes; ; I know I would die; If I could come back new; ; I'm down on my hands and knees; Every time the doorbell rings; I shake like a toothache; When I hear myself sing; All my lies are only wishes; ; I know I would die; If I could come back new; ; I would like to salute; The ashes of American flags; And all the falling leaves; Filling up shopping bags
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who wants to go back to his old life. He wants a good life with a nose for things, a fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy his suffering, a hole without a key if I break my tongue, speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come, all my lies are always my wishes. I think he is saying that he would die if he could come back to the old life he had. I'm down on my hands and knees, every time the doorbell rings, I shake like a toothache when I hear myself sing, All my lies, are only wishes, I know I would die, if I could go back new. I would like to salute the ashes of American flags, and all the falling leaves, filling up shopping bags. I love this song and I can't wait for the new album to come out!
Ground Truth: "All my lies are always wishesI know I would die if I could come back new"What an incredible line. He lies to impress... impress who? Himself, people around him, society... but the fact is he is living a lie to hide who he really is; which makes this an incredibly sad sad song. And yeah, great connection to the materialistic world we live in as well - one which, we need to drive fancy cars, live in big houses, dress in expensive clothes to cover and hide, to prove a point. People driving around in cars they can't afford to make people think they are something they are not... they are living wishes, which ultimately are lies. BDanahy14on September 16, 2010   
Lyrics: Let me tell you a story to chill the bones; Out of things that I saw; One night wandering in the everglades; I'd one drink but no more; I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight; Gazing up at the stars; Not aware of a presence so near to me; Watching my every move; ; Feeling scared and I fell to my knees; As something rushed me from the trees; Took me to an unholy place; And that is where I fell from grace; Then they summoned me over to join in with them; To the dance of the dead; Into the circle of fire I followed them; Into the middle I was led; ; As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear; But still I wanted to go; And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me; As I walked onto the coals; And I felt I was in a trance; And my spirit was lifted from me; And if only someone had the chance; To witness what happened to me; ; And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them; All had death in their eyes; Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them; They had ascended from hell; ; As I danced with the dead; My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me; Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead; Until the time came to reunite us both; My spirit came back down to me; I didn't know if I was alive or dead; As the others all joined in with me; ; By luck then a skirmish started; And took the attention away from me; When they took their gaze from me; Was the moment that I fled; I ran like hell faster than the wind; But behind I did not glance; One thing that I did not dare; Was to look just straight ahead; ; When you know that your time has come around; You know you'll be prepared for it; Say your last goodbyes to everyone; Drink and say a prayer for it; ; When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed; And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead; When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed; And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead; ; To this day I guess I'll never know; Just why they let me go; But I'll never go dancing no more; 'Til I dance with the dead
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who has just lost someone he loved and he is trying to get over it but he can't do it. He has to go to the woods and get away from the demons and demons. He doesn't know if he is alive or dead and he doesn't want to go back to his old ways. He wants to be free of the demons but he has to do it again and again. "When you know that your time has come aroundYou know you'll be prepared for itSay your last goodbyes to everyoneDrink and say a prayer for itWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're laying in your bedAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead"He is saying that he will never let go of his lost love. He will never forget his lost loved one. "To this day I guess I'll never knowJust why they let me goBut I'll Never Go Dancing No More'Til I Dance With The Dead"He will never be able to forget the lost love he had for his loved one and how much he will miss them. "I ran like hell faster than the windBut behind I did not glanceOne thing that I didn't dareWas to look just straight ahead"He was afraid that he would lose his love and he would never be free from his demons. The demons would never let him go. He would never go dancing no more. He is never going to forget what happened to him.
Ground Truth: The song is about the Danse Macabre, as someone stated above. It is a late-medieval allegory, depicting several skeletal figures dancing in a circle around Death incarnate. The figures are usually a king, an emperor, a young boy and a beautiful girl; all walks of life, no matter what you do or who you are, are united in death. Robert Burns, Scotland's national poet, wrote a poem called "Tam O'Shanter", in which a man witnesses the Danse Macabre. Basically, the song is like that poem; a man is walking alone, minding his own business, when suddenly this supernatural event takes place before his very eyes, and he ends up escaping from it. Hope this clears it up for anyone who wasn't sure! gillytine777on July 31, 2009   
Lyrics: And you neglected, I called you out, "Don't please"; I said, "We're stronger than this now!"; You resurrected mistakes, years past, it seemed...; And they exist to still haunt you!; ; And still you feel like the loneliness; Is better replaced by this; I don't believe it this way!; And I can see the fear in your eyes; I've seen it materialize; Growing stronger each day!; ; I could see it as you turned to stone; Still, clearly I can hear you say; "Don't leave, don't give up on me"; Two weeks and you ran away; I remember, don't lie to me; You couldn't see that it was not that way; Swear I never gave up on you; ; I wanted nothing but for that trust again; And brick by brick, you would take it; You feared of phantoms and none exist but you!; You still saw fit to destroy it!; ; And still you feel like the loneliness; Is better replaced by this; I don't believe it this way!; And I can see the fear in your eyes; I've seen it materialize; Growing stronger each day!; ; I could see it as you turned to stone; Still, clearly I can hear you say; "Don't leave, don't give up on me"; Two weeks and you ran away; I remember, don't lie to me; You couldn't see that it was not that way; Swear I never gave up on you; ; And you neglected, I called you out, "Don't please"; I said, "We're stronger than this now!"; You feared of phantoms and none exist but you!; You still saw fit to destroy it!; ; And I can see the fear in your eyes; I've seen it materialize; Growing stronger each day!; ; I could see it as you turned to stone; Still, clearly I can hear you say; "Don't leave, don't give up on me"; Two weeks and you ran away; ; I could see it as you turned to stone; Still, clearly I can hear you say; "Don't leave, don't give up on me"; Two weeks and you ran away; ; I remember, don't lie to me,; You couldn't see that it was not that way,; Swear I never gave up on you!; I could see it as you turned to stone,; Still, clearly I can hear you say,; "Don't leave, don't give up on me."; Two weeks and you ran away.; I remember, don't lie to me,; You couldn't see that it was not that way,; Swear I never gave up on you!
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy and a girl who have been together for a long time, but one of them has changed for the better and the other doesn't want to be with him anymore. The guy is trying to tell the girl that he's not going to give up on her and that he doesn't care about her anymore and that she's better off without him.
Ground Truth: Here is my (probably not correct) interpretation:And you neglected I called you out don't pleaseI said we're stronger than this nowi: the person refuses to believe the narrator had been trying to reach out to themii: the narrator is telling the listener that both of them have apparently overcome what they're struggling with; opposed to the narrator stating to the listener that both of them are acting juvenile; or opposed to the narrator just reassuring the listener that both the L & N are better. You resurrected mistakes years past it seemedAnd they exist to still haunt youi: the listener (or the character in the story of this song) is bringing up past mistakes (minor or huge mistakes) by the narrator that have been hurting the listener for so longii: the mistakes still haunt themAnd still you feel like the lonelinessIs better replaced by thisI don't believe it this wayi: the listener is departing from the narrator because they feel like they are more safe from them, or that they're simply disappointed in the narrator, or that they just feel they need to separate from each other for some time, or they passed away but that isn't likely in this caseii: the narrator objects this person's actions, they feel that it wasn't necessary for this person to separate from the narrator. Especially if those mistakes were minorAnd I can see the fear in your eyesI'm seeing the teary liesGrowing stronger each dayi:the listener is becoming more distant from the narrator and the narrator notices it. The listener is afraid of the narrator and basically is hiding from his/her sight whenever possibleI could see it as you turned to stoneStill clearly I can hear you sayi: it becomes apparent that the listener is avoiding the narrator and the narrator is clearly stating this with emphasisii: yet the narrator still looks back to the past and is still struggling with the listener's departureDon't leave, don't give up on meTwo weeks and you ran awayi: the narrator is restating the words the listener apparently said to the narrator and how t

Lyrics: If you want to live, let live; If you want to go, let go; I'm not afraid to dream, to sleep, sleep forever; I don't need to touch the sky; I just want to feel that high; And you refuse to lift me; ; Guess it wasn't real after all; Guess it wasn't real all along; ; If I fall and all is lost; It's where I belong; ; If you want to live, let live; If you want to go, let go; I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender; ; Guess it wasn't real after all; Guess it wasn't real all along; ; If I fall and all is lost; No light to lead the way; Remember that all alone is where I belong; ; In a dream; Will you give your love to me?; Beg my broken heart to beat?; Save my life, change my mind; ; If I fall and all is lost; No light to lead the way; Remember that all alone is where I belong
Sample outputs: I love this song. I think it's about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him. He wants her to be happy, but he doesn't know what to do about it. He's not afraid to dream, he's not scared to sleep forever. He doesn't need to touch the sky, he wants to feel high. But she refuses to lift him, so he's asking her if she'll love him, if she wants to go with him, and if she's willing to let go of him. She's saying that if she does, she's not going to be there for him. It's a sad song, but it's a beautiful one.
Ground Truth: yes the album is different...i have to admitt my reactions when i heard the fallen album were better than when i heard this one...i still like this album though but it might take longer to grow on me...but there are some songs on it tt really stand out! this song wasn't one of them....some of the songs sound kinda sameyDeath_Is_Hereditaryon October 04, 2006   
Lyrics: Loving you is easy; I can do it in my sleep; I dream of you so often; It's like you never leave; But you're gone below the border; With a nightmare in between; I'm sending the coyote; To bring you back to me; ; Where there's a fancy hotel waiting; In south San Gabriel; Where the movie madams sunbathe; The playboys para-sail; And I know you think I'm crazy; But most people they can't tell; So I'll meet you there tomorrow; If I can have you to myself; ; Inside the time I tried to occupy or waste; Since you've been away; It's hard our plans are stalled on calling cards; I can't see your poker face; While your voice is sounding so brave; ; Our Lady Guadalupe; In plaster on the wall; Joseph Smith saw Jesus in America; Well I don't know much about it; It doesn't matter much at all; Just keep your head down lady; As you travel through the dark; ; And if I should seem distracted; By the color of the sky; As a copper wire sunset plays a lullaby; It's just to know they've stolen; Another day from you and I; It gets me feeling low down; When the moon is fulling high; ; They bait the route; To take the place that's safe; That you might wait a day; ; A lonesome broken dawn; That finally comes; Just as I was losing faith; You keep every promise you make; ; Loving you is easy; I can do it in my sleep; I dream of you so often; It's like you never leave; But you're gone below the border; With a nightmare in between; So I'm sending the coyote; To bring you back to me; Yes I'm sending the coyote; To bring you back to me
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man and a woman who are in a relationship, and the man is trying to convince her to stay with him, but she has been away from him for a long time, and he can't see her poker face. He wants to be with her, but he knows she won't come back, so he's sending the coyote to bring her back to him.
Ground Truth: Lyric CorrectionLoving you is easy- I can do it in my sleep. I dream of you so often it's like you never leave. But you're gone below the border with a nightmare in between. I'm sending the coyote to bring you back to me. There's a fancy hotel waiting In south San GabrielWhere the movie madams sunbathe, the playboys parasail. And I know you think I'm crazy, but most people they can't tell. So I'll meet you there tomorrow, If I can have you to myself. Inside the time I tried to occupy or waste since you've been away,It's hard. Our plan's are stalled. On calling cards, I can't see yourPoker face, while your voice is sounding so brave. Our Lady Guadalupe in plaster on the wall,Joseph Smith saw Jesus in America. Well I don't know much about it. It doesn't matter much at all. Just keep your head down lady as you travel through the dark. If I should seem distracted by the color of the sky as a copper wire sunset plays a lullaby. It's just to know they've stolen another day from you and I. It gets me feeling low down when the moon is full and high. They bait the route to take the place that's safe that you might wait a day. The lonesome broken dawn, it finally comes just as I was losing faith. You keep every promise you make. Loving you is easy- I can do it in my sleep. I dream of you so often it's like you never leave. But you're gone below the border with a nightmare in between. So I'm sending the coyote to bring you back to me. Yes, I'm sending the coyote to bring you back to me. Jacknighfon November 10, 2010   
Lyrics: Here tonight I clock a thousand heads; Here to unite, through common dreads; Now who's with me?; Now who's with me?; ; Something trips inside; That's been dormant for a thousand years; Now we can no longer hide; The immediacy of these fears; ; Our names will not be writ on water; And we don't need an ark; One day I know the dam will collapse; And we will be the current; Yes, what have you got for me?; ; And now the flood gates will open; Strike; You cannot open the door; You cannot open the door; ; We will sing as one in solidarity; We will swim together; No longer treading water; We're flowing with the tide; ; And you can taste the night; Don't waste the night; We will sing as one in solidarity; We will sing together; ; And still we will be here; Standing like statues; The time is now, belt it brothers; ; We will sing as one in solidarity; We will sing together; We will sing as one in solidarity; We will sing together; ; We will sing as one in solidarity; We will sing together; We will sing as one in solidarity; We will sing together
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how the world is going to end soon, and we will have to unite to fight for it. "Now who's with me?" I think this means that the world will end soon. "Something trips insideThat's been dormant for a thousand yearsNow we can no longer hideThe immediacy of these fearsOur names will not be writ on waterAnd we don't need an arkOne day I know the dam will collapseAnd we will be the currentYes, what have you got for me?" This means that we are going to fight and fight for what we believe in. "And now the flood gates will openStrike, you cannot open the door"This means that there will be a flood of people who will stand up for what they believe in, and that they will not have to worry about what other people think of them. "We will swim togetherNo longer treading waterWe're flowing with the tideAnd you can taste the nightDon't waste the nightWe will sing as one in solidaritywe will sing together"This is saying that we will fight for our beliefs and beliefs, and they will be there for us no matter what. I also think that this is a song about the end of the world, and how we will stand together and fight to keep the world going. That's what I think of when I hear this song.
Ground Truth: solidarity is really an epic songit says that all the people should unite to make the world a better place and to stop all the shit that's going on nowadaysthere are so many things that destroy our society and the earth and enter shikari want to encourage the people to do something against all thatgj39on August 02, 2010   
Lyrics: Baby, don't you know I suffer?; Baby, can you hear me moan?; You caught me under false pretenses; How long before you let me go?; ; You set my soul alight; You set my soul alight; ; (You) glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (set my soul alight); ; (You) glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (set my soul); ; I thought I was a fool for no one; But baby, I'm a fool for you; You're the queen of the superficial; And how long before you tell the truth?; ; You set my soul alight; You set my soul alight; ; (You) glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (set my soul alight); ; (You) glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (set my soul); ; Supermassive black hole; Supermassive black hole; Supermassive black hole; Supermassive black hole; ; Glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive; ; Glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive; ; (You) glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (set my soul alight); ; (You) glaciers melting in the dead of night; And the superstars sucked into the supermassive (set my soul); ; Supermassive black hole; Supermassive black hole; Supermassive black hole; Supermassive black hole
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is obsessed with a girl and he can't seem to get over her, and he's trying to convince himself that he's not a fool for her. "Glaciers melting in the dead of nightAnd the superstars sucked into the supermassive"I think he's referring to the fact that she's so beautiful that she can't be with him. "I thought I was a fool, for no oneBut baby, I'm a fool to youYou're the queen of the superficialAnd how long before you tell the truth?" I think this means that he doesn't want to be with her because she's superficial, but he's in love with her so much that he thinks she's the only one who understands him.
Ground Truth: i really liked this song then it got on the twighlight soundtrack and i like it even more. everytime i hear it, it makes me want to go see twighlight again. Kate[tcf]luv[tbs]on December 03, 2008   Link2 Replies 
Lyrics: Shake it like a ladder to the sun; Makes me feel like a madman on the run; Find me, never, never far gone; So get your leather, leather, leather on, on, on, on; ; You're a zero; What's your name? No one's gonna ask you; Better find out where they want you to go; Try and hit the spot, get to know it in the dark; Get to know it whether you're crying, crying, crying, oh, oh; Can you climb, climb, climb higher?; ; Shake it like a ladder to the sun; Makes me feel like a madman on the run; No you're never, never far gone; So get your leather, leather, leather on, on, on, on; ; You're a zero; What's your name? No one's gonna ask you; Better find out where they want you to go; Try and hit the spot, get to know it in the dark; Get to know it whether you're crying, crying, crying, oh, oh; Can you climb, climb, climb higher?; ; Was it the cure? Shellshock; Was it the cure? Hope not; Was it the cure? Shellshock; Was it the cure? What's your name?; ; You're a zero; What's your name? No one's gonna ask you; Better find out where they want you to go; Try and hit the spot, get to know it in the dark; Get to know it whether you're crying, crying, crying, oh, oh; Can you climb, climb, climb higher?; ; Was it the cure? Shellshock; Was it the cure? Hope not; Was it the cure? Shellshock; Was it the cure? Hope not; ; What's your name? What's your name?; What's your name? What's your name?; What's your name? What's your name?; What's your name?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a woman who is on the run from the law and the law. She's "never far gone" because she doesn't have to be a criminal or anything like that. She wants to get out of the law, get her leather on, get to know where they want her to go. She doesn't want anyone to know her name, she just wants to know who she is and what she's trying to do. "Shake it like a ladder to the sun, makes me feel like a madman on a run. Find me, never, never far gone. So get your leather, leather on on on, on on." She's talking about a man who is a zero, but she wants him to find out who he really is. "You're a zeroWhat's your nameNo one's gonna ask youBetter find out whereThey want you to goTry and hit the spotGet to know it in the darkGet to Know it whether you're crying, crying, cryin'Oh, can you climb, climb higher?" She's asking him to tell her where he's going. "Was it the cure? Shellshock? Was it the Cure? Hope not." She is asking him if he's the only one who knows what he's doing. The "shellshock" is that he's just not sure what to do, because he's not sure how to go about it. The rest of the song seems to be about how it's hard to figure out what the law is.
Ground Truth: Watch the music video. It is about a song for the "losers" who consider themselves zeroes. and she is saying, yes you will stay a zero unless you make a name for yourself. "Your a zeroWhat's your name? No one's going to ask youBetter find out where they want you to go"No body cares about you, therefore they do not need to know your name. It is how (some of the) famous people treat the everyday person (losers)happyfacedloseron July 10, 2009
