Lyrics: Don't wanna be an American idiot.; Don't want a nation under the new media; And can you hear the sound of hysteria?; The subliminal mind fck America.; ; Welcome to a new kind of tension.; All across the alien nation.; Where everything isn't meant to be okay.; Television dreams of tomorrow.; We're not the ones who're meant to follow.; For that's enough to argue.; ; Well maybe I'm the faggt America.; I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.; Now everybody do the propaganda.; And sing along to the age of paranoia.; (Are you looking at me?!); ; Welcome to a new kind of tension.; All across the alien nation.; Where everything isn't meant to be okay.; Television dreams of tomorrow.; We're not the ones who're meant to follow.; For that's enough to argue.; ; Hey!; Don't wanna be an American idiot.(Hey!); One nation controlled by the media.(Hey!); Information age of hysteria.(Hey!); It's calling out to idiot America.; ; Welcome to a new kind of tension.; All across the alien nation.; Where everything isn't meant to be okay.; Television dreams of tomorrow.; We're not the ones who're meant to follow.; For that's enough to argue.
Sample outputs: This is one of my favorite songs. It's one of the best songs I've ever listened to. I think it's about how the media can't do anything for us, and that we need to stop being stupid and just listen to the music. I don't know if I'm right, but I think this song is about the end of the media, and the beginning of the new era of america, and how we are not going to be able to change the way we see the world because we don't want to be a part of it, because we are stupid, and we want to change how we view the world, so we have to change our way of seeing the world. And it's not about the media. That's just how I see it.
Ground Truth: Oh man! SoundGarden, Pearl Jam, Screaming Trees, Nirvana, AIC.,... If you ask me almost anything that was "scene" to come out of the ninties actually has some merit,I'd rank alot of those bands up there with Zeppelin simply because they appreciate and care about the music they write....TheLandoftheBlind knows how it is :) lolN0 C0DE 79on February 25, 2006   
Lyrics: Your misery is worn as a veil; To hide bewitchment of the ugliest kind; In place of Eve a bitter parody hails; Daggers from the swagger of a sodomite's concubine (...bine... bine); ; Gilded cunt; Oh, you gilded cunt; ; Your thin pretence overstretched and sickly; Feigns love and light a long time laid in the grave; My preference leans to killing you quickly; Scissored in the gizzard that a heart no more maintains; ; But I am tied; To the labyrinth and the beast; The one way track of eyes; Black and grey like panzers; ; Loose your shell; Shoot the mouth; The gates of hell; Have often dropped their jaws about; Satan's agents are perversions to bear; Side to side with the diversions you use to guide my fingers there; Dirty little gold digger; Dirty little gold digger; Dirty little gold digger; Dirty little gold digger; Dirty little gold digger; Dirty little gold digger; ; Cunt, cunt, gilded cunt; Oh, you gilded cunt; Cunt; Cunt; ; Nothing is above you save a boreal light; That halo paid for by a consummated ring of ice; And below you, will I see you tonight; Glower from your tower built of ivory and spite?; ; For I am torn; Between the sheets that keep me borne; And the teeth of a storm; They reap then rend my stanzas; ; Click your heels; Three times six; The stars are fixed; May I climb and get you one?; The palace at Versailles never held your tongue; Nor did heaven ever weather the crosses that you came upon; Dirty little soul frigger; Dirty little soul frigger; Dirty little soul frigger; Dirty little soul frigger; Dirty little soul frigger; Dirty little soul frigger; ; Cunt, cunt, gilded cunt; Oh, you gilded cunt; Take your pain and shove it up your asshole (cunt); Take your pain and shove it up your asshole (cunt); Take your pain and shove it up your asshole; Take your pain and shove it up your asshole; Take your pain and shove it up your asshole; Take your pain and shove it up your asshole
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a woman who is in love with a man, but she can't love him because she doesn't want him to be with her, and she wants him to love her, but he can't. She wants him, so she kills him, but the man wants her. She doesn't know how to love him, she wants to give him a chance, but in the end, he won't.

Lyrics: So you think I'm alone?; But being alone's the only way to be; When you step outside; You spend life fighting for your sanity; ; This is a cold war; You better know what you're fighting for; This is a cold war; Do you know what you're fighting for?; ; If you want to be free; The underground is the only place to be; 'Cause in this life; You spend time running from depravity; ; This is a cold war; Do you know what you're fighting for?; This is a cold war; You better know what you're fighting for; This is a cold war; You better know what you're fighting for; This is a cold war; Do you know what you're fighting for?; ; Bring wings to the weak and bring grace to the strong; Make all evil stumble as it flies in the world; All the tribes comes and the mighty will crumble; We must brave this night and have faith in love; ; I'm trying to find my peace; I was made to believe there's something wrong with me; And it hurts my heart; Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?; ; That this is a cold war; Do you know what you're fighting for; This is a cold war; You better know what you're fighting for; ; This is a cold...; This is a cold war; You better know what you're fighting for; Do you know? Is a cold...; Do you?; Do you?; Do you?; Is a cold ...; You better know what you're fighting for
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a person who is trying to find peace in the world, but she is not able to find it because she is afraid of losing her peace. She is afraid that she is going to lose her peace and that she will have to fight for what she is fighting for, because she knows she is alone, and she has to be in love with someone. She knows that she can't live her life without them, and that is why she is in the war. She wants to be free, but in the end she is unable to find her peace, because in this war, she is too afraid to be with them, because the only way she can have peace is to fight the war, and if she wants to, she needs to be together with the people she loves, and not be in a war with them. She can't be alone, because of the fact that she doesn't know what she's fighting for. She has to fight her way out of the war and try to find the peace she wants. She needs to know that she's not alone, that she has no peace, and can't fight for her sanity. She doesn't want to be alone because she's afraid that her peace will be lost. That's why she says she's going to fight against the war because she has lost her faith in God. She's trying to make peace, but her faith is not there, so she's just waiting for the war to end, and then she realizes it's too late, she won't be able to fight. She won't have the peace that she needs, and it's just too late. It's not about her, it's about her. It is about her fighting for her own peace, that's what she wants, but it's not what she needs. She feels like she is the only one who knows what's going on, and is afraid to fight, because it's the only thing she can fight for. But she knows that this war is not going to end. She just needs to get over it and find peace. This is a cold war, do you know what you're fighting for?

Lyrics: They came at night leaving fear behind; Shadows were on the ground; ; Nobody knew where to find him; No evidence was found; "I'm never coming back"; They heard him cry and I believe him; ; Well he never meant to do anything wrong; It's gonna get worse if he waits too long; Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you; ; Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh no; Searching through the day and into the night; They wouldn't stop till they found him; ; They didn't know him and they didn't understand; They never asked him why; "Get out of my way"; They heard him shout then a blinding light; ; Ooh all I could see was him running down the street; Out of the shadows and into the night; Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh; ; Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh; Don't give up; Keep running, keep hiding; ; Don't give up; Billy, if you know you're right; Don't give up; You know that I am on your side; ; Don't give up; Oh Billy, you better, you better, you better run for your life; Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh; ; Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh; Nobody knew where to find him; No evidence was found; He never meant to do anything wrong; It's gonna get worse if he waits too long; Billy, Billy don't you lose my number; 'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh; Now Billy, oh; Now Billy
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl, but he doesn't want to be with her because he knows she's not there for him. He wants her to know that he's there for her, but she doesn't know how to help him. She's afraid that he won't find her, because she's afraid of being with him. The girl is scared that she won't be with him, and she's scared that he'll hurt her, so she runs for her life. She wants him to know she's there, but it's not going to work out, and he's scared to tell her that he isn't going to be able to find her. She knows it's going to get worse if he waits too long. She doesn't really know if she'll ever find him, or if she will find him. But she knows that if she does, he'll be there, and that she'll never find him again, because he's afraid she'll be hurt. She just wants to know if he'll ever see her again, and if he will, she'll tell him that she loves him, but that she is afraid that she will hurt him. And she is scared to let him know that she's still in love with him because she knows he'll never let her go. She is afraid of losing her number. She can't let him go, because it's too late for her. And if she can't, then she'll just keep running. She needs to get out of the shadows and into the night, because there's no way she can find him anymore. She still wants to find him but she knows it won't work out. She has to find a way to make it work, because if she keeps running, she will never be found. She'll never get there. That's why she wants to tell him not to do anything wrong, because that's what she needs to do, and it's just too hard for her to do. So she's just going to wait for him, because of her fear that he will hurt her. "You know that I am on your side, Billy don't you lose my number, cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh"She wants to make him feel better, but knows that he can't.
Ground Truth: "The lyrics might seem like nonsense, but that's because they came from stream-of-consciousness writing sessions. Collins himself says there is no real story or message in the song. The MTV-friendly video spoofs the Police, the Cars, Michael Jackson, David Lee Roth and many other stars of the day." rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-best-phil-collins-songs-20131211/…djeheutyon October 12, 2017   
Lyrics: As I recall when my stomach turned; And I was hiding away from myself; Away from you; Like nothing though something was terribly wrong; And I admit that I was only waiting for the right time, night time; The right moment for you to look away; Though you never did I pretended for a while; So I could walk where I don't belong; ; I remember every word you said; Come back in time come back; And I remember I would soon be dead; Pitiful so pitiful; ; But I know, as they hammered those nails, into your beautiful hands; Your eyes they tried to search for mine; But I look away; Now your eyes are the only thing that can save me; I'm still afraid of them piercing; You're breaking into my prison; Just pretended for a while; I still decided to walk away; ; I remember every word you said; Come back in time come back; And I remember I would soon be dead; Pitiful so pitiful; ; Pitiful; Pitiful; Your Pitiful; Pitiful; So Pitiful; ; And I remember every word you said; But this time I won't look away; And I remember every word you said; And this time I won't look away; ; And I remember every word you said; Come back in time come back; And I remember I would soon be dead; Pitiful so pitiful; ; And I remember every word you said (pitiful); Come back in time come back (pitiful); And I remember I would soon be dead(pitiful); Pitiful so pitiful
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but he can't be with her because she's not there for him. So he tries to pretend for a while that he doesn't want her to be with him, but she doesn't. And then he realizes that he's not with her anymore, and that he wants her back, and he's afraid that she'll break into his prison, because he knows she won't look away. And he's still afraid of them piercing, because she knows that she's breaking into her prison, and she can't walk away from him anymore. I think it's about how she's afraid of him and that she wants him to come back to her, and it's hard for her to walk away because she isn't there for her anymore. But she's still scared and she wants to go back to him, and so she's waiting for the right time, night time, the right moment for you to look away, but that's not going to happen. She's afraid she'll hurt him, so she keeps trying to hide from him. But that's just the way it is, because it doesn't work. And she's scared that he'll hurt her, that he will never be able to have her back. And when she says "Pitiful so pitiful" she means that she knows she's going to hurt him. And in the end, she is afraid that he won't come back, because that's the only thing that can save her. And that's what I think of it. It's about a girl who wants to be loved, but doesn't know what to do with herself, and is afraid to be around her. She is afraid of being hurt by him, which is why she's telling him she'll never be loved again. And it's kind of like she's trying to tell him that she will never love him again, but it's just too hard for him to tell her that he loves her, because they're not the same person, but they can't let go of each other, because of the hurt they're going through, and the fact that she is scared of him, that they're all going to be hurt again, and they're afraid to talk to each other. And "I remember every word you saidCome back in time come back" is a reference to her saying that she would never be happy without him. "And I remember I would soon be dead"

She wants to get away from him, because she knows he won't let her go. "You know you've gotta save some for the shoeshine boyYou've been pulling them by the hand insideOh collecting all your toysIf you need a lead to heaven nowJust stick around, you're gonna be thereWhat do you care?

I think he's telling her that he doesn't care about her anymore. He's saying that he wants her to stay with him. "All she wants, is all she wants"He's asking her to tell him what she wants to do, and if she's willing to do it, she'll be there for him. She's asking him what he wants, and he tells her that she'll have to give him everything she wants. "God, can't keep, the word is leaking out with your pleasure, in suspension, not to mention, what you hung it around." He's asking if she'll give him her toys, so he can get away with it, but he's not going to give up on her. He wants to give her everything she needs, and give her a place to share in every position. He knows she'll never be able to do that, but it's too late for her. She knows that he'll always be there, and it's the only way to get her back. I don't think she'll ever get over him. I love this song so much, and I can't wait to hear more of it.
Ground Truth: Interesting reference there to the Shining, Canada. You could very well be onto something there. I too believe that the song relays more than the obvious - on the other hand it seems to be like Simon having a field day with his creative outpourings. ;-)Lyrical8on March 12, 2010   
Lyrics: It'd been too many times that i stuck out my neck; for you; it's been too many times that i spoke my mind; for you; it's been too many times that i caught all the flak; from you; apathetic crap is all i can find; in you; I don't want no part in this; i don't feel the need to score; burnt all bridges close to the heart; i don't want to be a part; no more; Dosvidanija ciao adieu; hasta la vista i'm on my way; goodbye sayonara; auf nimmerweidersehen; over and out; and down the drain; It's been too many times that i raised my voice; at you; it's been too many times that i walked the line; with you; it's been too many times that ive had no choice; but you; hypocritical swine i have had it this time; thank you; I don't want no part in this; i don't feel the need to score; burnt all bridges close to the heart; i don't want to be a part; no more; Dosvidanija ciao adieu; hasta la vista i'm on my way; goodbye sayonara; auf nimmerweidersehen; over and out; and down the drain
Sample outputs: I love this song. It's about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl he loves. He's trying to tell her that he doesn't want to be a part of the relationship. He wants her to be happy, but he knows that he can't be with her. He doesn't feel the need to score. "Burn all bridges close to the heart"He's saying that he wants to be there for her, but she's telling him that she's not going to be with him. "I don't want no part in this"He doesn't know what to do with her anymore. "It's been too many times that I stuck out my neck for you"He knows that she'll always be there, and that he'll never be able to stop loving her. "But you hypocritical swine, I have had it this time thank you." He's telling her that she has to let go of him, because she's the one who has hurt him, and he's not willing to give up on her, because he's the only one who knows what she's going through. He knows she's right, and she knows it. "Dosvidanija ciao adieu"It's about how he feels about her, and how she's been there. She's been hurt, and it's all she can do to make him feel better. "Till I'm done, I'm on my way, I don't wanna be part of this." He is saying goodbye to her, he's done with her, she's gone. "Auf nimmerweidersehen over and out, and down the drain"I think this is about a girl who is trying to get him to forgive her for the way he treated her. She doesn't deserve to be forgiven. She has been there for him, done that, and now she's done it again. He'll never forgive her again. I think this song is about how she feels about him, but that's just my take on it.
Ground Truth: This song was written as a lead-off track to set the tone of what was to be KMFDM's final album with Wax Trax Records, having fulfilled their contract obligations with the label. KMFDM was generating a ton of money for the label during a time when most bands have left or been sold off to majors. The song is a straight-forward "Fuck You" to the label that's releasing it. Coincidentally, this also became the last album Sascha Konietzko worked on with Gunter Schulz and En Esch. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to end the band's run with an album named "Adios". Of course, they did reform due to "popular demand," according to Sascha. torqon July 09, 2010   
Lyrics: Lightning crashes, a new mother cries; Her placenta falls to the floor; The angel opens her eyes; The confusion sets in; Before the doctor can even close the door; ; Lightning crashes, an old mother dies; Her intentions fall to the floor; The angel closes her eyes; The confusion that was hers; Belongs now, to the baby down the hall; ; Oh now feel it comin' back again; Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind; Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again; I can feel it; ; Lightning crashes, a new mother cries; This moment she's been waiting for; The angel opens her eyes; Pale blue colored iris, presents the circle; And puts the glory out to hide, hide; ; Oh now feel it comin' back again; Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind; Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again; I can feel it; I can feel it; ; I can feel it comin' back again; Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind; Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again; I can feel it; ; I can feel it comin' back again; Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind; Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again; I can feel it; I can feel it comin' back again; Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind; Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again; I can feel it; I can feel it; I can feel it
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a new mother who is having an abortion. She is trying to get the baby out of her womb. The baby is in the middle of the night, and the doctor is the only one who can see the baby. They are trying to figure out what to do with the baby and how to get it out. "Lightning crashes, an old mother diesHer intentions fall to the floorThe angel closes her eyesThe confusion that was hersBelongs now to the baby down the hall"The baby dies, but the doctor can't see it. The doctor is not able to open the door because the baby is already dead, so she has to wait for the baby to get out of the womb. "I can feel it comin' back againLike a rollin' thunder chasing the wind Forces pulling from the center of the earth again"I think the baby can feel the pain, but she can't help but feel it. It's a great song, and one of the best songs I've ever heard.
Ground Truth: I think people let the placenta line throw them off to easily. In a "Hey! You're in labor! =D!" situation, like the one this gives me the impression of, it's not uncommon for the doctors to have everything set up. Hence: Placenta on zee floor. addseale2on May 10, 2006   
Lyrics: Met a girl, thought she was grand; Fell in love, found out first hand; Went well for a week or two; Then it all came unglued; ; In a trap, trip I can't grip; Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip; Then I started to realize; I was living one big lie; ; She fucking hates me; Trust, she fucking hates me; La, la, la love; I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none; And ripped them away; ; She was queen for about an hour; After that, shit got sour; She took all I ever had; No sign of guilt; Not feeling bad, no; ; In a trap, trip I can't grip; Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip; Then I started to realize; I was livin' one big lie; ; She fuckin' hates me; Trust, she fuckin' hates me; La, la, la love; I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none; And ripped them away; ; That's my story as you see; Learned my lesson and so did she; Now it's over, and I'm glad; 'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said; ; She fucking hates me; Trust, she fucking hates me; La, la, la love; I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none; And ripped them away; ; La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, trust; La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, trust; La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, trust; And she tore my feelings like I had none; She fucking hates me; ; (I never got any action); "She fuckin' hates me"; (I never got any action anyway)
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been in a relationship with a girl that has cheated on him and he doesn't want to admit it. He doesn't know what to do, but he can't deny that he cheated on her and he doesnt want to let her go. He wants her to know that he is in love with her and that he loves her and wants to get back together with her, but she doesnt want him to be with her. He knows that she is cheating on him, and he knows it. So he tells her that she needs to tell him that she loves him, because he knows she's cheating on her, and that she hates him. He feels like he has to tell her that he has no feelings for her, because she doesn't deserve to be cheated on. He can't let her know that she's hurting him, or that he's not worth it. And he wants to know if she's going to forgive him or not. He really wants her back, but then he realizes that she won't forgive him because he's hurting her. "I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none, and ripped them away"She's telling him that he needs to get over her, that he'll never be able to get her back. "She's my story as you see Learned my lesson and so did sheNow it's over and I'm glad 'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said"This is the best part of the song. I think it's about how he feels about the girl, and how he knows that he will never get over it. "Trust, she fucking hates me"He's telling her he's sorry for what he did to her. But he's also telling her that no matter how hard he tries, he still loves her, even though he knows he'll get hurt. He's saying that she'll never forgive him for what she did to him, even if it hurts him to do it again. He also tells her he'll always love her.
Ground Truth: This is a great song im listening 2 it over and over again and he does sound so much like Kurt Cobain and anyone that says he doesnt can go fuck emselves its not somefink u headbang along 2 it somefink tht u sit there and bounce your head along 2it in my opinion means that hes just broke up with his girlfriend and hes thoroughly pissed off if you've seen the video its probaly his first girlfriend and now hes emotionaly damaged tht she broke up with him and she just like tht doesnt giv a shit about him while he still adores herKurt Cobain Rules!!!

Lyrics: Is it my imagination; Or have I finally found something worth living for?; I was looking for some action; But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol; ; You could wait for a lifetime; To spend your days in the sunshine; You might as well do the white line; 'Cos when it comes on top; ; You gotta make it happen; You gotta make it happen; You gotta make it happen; You gotta make it happen; ; Is it worth the aggravation; To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?; It's a crazy situation; But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol; ; You could wait for a lifetime; To spend your days in the sunshine; You might as well do the white line; Cos when it comes on top; ; You gotta make it happen; You gotta make it happen; You gotta make it happen; You gotta make it happen; ; You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it; You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it; You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it; You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is trying to break out of his comfort zone. He's trying to find a job, but he doesn't have the money to do it, and he's looking for something that's worth living for. "You could wait for a lifetimeTo spend your days in the sunshineYou might as well do the white line 'cause when it comes on top"He's saying that he wants to be happy, but his life isn't worth it. "Is it worth the aggravation to find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for? It's a crazy situation, but all I need are cigarettes and alcohol"I think he's talking about how he's tired of working and wants to get out of it. He wants to make it happen, but it's too late. "I can't wait to spend my days on the sunshine"He wants to spend his time with his friends, but they aren't going to be able to make him happy. "But all I can do is smoke and drink." He's saying he can't do that, because he's not going to find anything worth doing. "C'mon, I'm going to make my own decision." I don't think it's worth it, but I can't help but think that he's trying. He doesn't want to get caught up in his life, so he's just going to have to fake it. I think that's what this song means to him. He can't get over the fact that he has no money to spend, and it's just too hard to get over it.
Ground Truth: yea man, this iz the best eva song that means so much to loads of us as its so fuckin true, fuck blur, let them sing bout country houses, this is the real shit man, this is rok 'n' roll and exactly what being young 2day is all aboutBoon August 28, 2002

Lyrics: Do you know what's worth fighting for?; When it's not worth dying for; Does it take your breath away?; And you feel yourself suffocating; ; Does the pain weigh out the pride?; And you look for a place to hide; Did someone break your heart inside?; You're in ruins; ; One, twenty-one guns; Lay down your arms, give up the fight; One, twenty-one guns; Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I; ; When you're at the end of the road; And you lost all sense of control; And your thoughts have taken their toll; When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul; ; Your faith walks on broken glass; And the hangover doesn't pass; Nothing's ever built to last; You're in ruins; ; One, twenty-one guns; Lay down your arms, give up the fight; One, twenty-one guns; Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I; ; Did you try to live on your own?; When you burned down the house and home; Did you stand too close to the fire; Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?; ; When it's time to live and let die; And you can't get another try; Something inside this heart has died; You're in ruins; ; One, twenty-one guns; Lay down your arms, give up the fight; One, twenty-one guns; Throw up your arms into the sky; ; One, twenty-one guns; Lay down your arms, give up the fight; One, twenty-one guns; Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is trying to find a place to hide from his problems. He's trying to get out of his problems, but he can't because he's scared of the consequences of his actions. He wants to get back to his life, and he wants to die. But he doesn't know what to do, so he's afraid to go out and fight for what he believes in. He doesn't want to give up, and that's why he's so scared of dying. He is afraid of what he'll lose, because he knows he'll die in the end. He can't get another try, because something inside this heart has died. He knows he's going to die, but it's too late. He realizes that he's not going to get another chance, and so he decides to kill himself. "One, twenty-one guns, lay down your arms, give up the fight." He's afraid that he'll get killed. "When you're at the end of the roadAnd you lost all sense of controlAnd your thoughts have taken their tollWhen your mind breaks the spirit of your soulYour faith walks on broken glassAnd the hangover doesn't passNothing's ever built to lastYou're in ruins"He's afraid of losing his faith, and in the process he realizes that it's not worth fighting for. He feels like he's lost his faith in God, and is afraid to give it another try. "Something inside this Heart has died"He realizes that there's more to life than he's ever known, and wants to move on. "I know what's worth dying for?" He's scared that he will die, and knows that he has to do something about it. "Do you try to live on your ownWhen you burned down the house and homeDid you stand too close to the fireLike a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone? When it's time to live and let dieAnd you can'tget another trySomething inside that heart has die"He knows that his faith has died, and it's only a matter of time before he dies, and when he dies he'll be able to live his life again, but that's just my opinion.
Ground Truth: I think that the song is referring to the Battle at the Alamo''Do you know what's worth fighting for, When it's not worth dying for?" is Sam Huston saying that the war is worth fighting for but not like this. "You're in ruins" is referring to the Alamo being, well, in ruins"One, twenty one guns" is referring to the Alamo is the only one mission with 21 cannons"Lay down your arms, Give up the fight" refers to Sam telling the Texans not to defend the Alamo"When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul. Your faith walks on broken glass" is referring to the Texans knowing that they will die but the still want to defend the Alamo"When you burned down the house and home?" is referring to the Runaway Scrape"Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone" is saying that defending the Alamo is pointlessWell that's all i got. Hope it helps. :)noitallon March 17, 2013   
Lyrics: Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time; For y'all have knocked her up.; I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe; I was not offended; For I knew I had to rise above it all; Or drown in my own shit.; ; Come on Maggot Brain; Go on Maggot Brain
Sample outputs: "Mother Earth is pregnant for the third timeFor yall have knocked her upI have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universeI was not offendedFor I knew I had to rise above it allOr drown in my own shitCome on Maggot BrainGo on maggot brainGo onMaggot Brain"I think this song is about a woman who has had a miscarriage, and she has been pregnant for three times. She is not offended by the fact that she is pregnant, and that she has become pregnant. She has tasted the Maggots that are in her mind. She knows she has to rise over it all or drown in her own shit. I think this is about her trying to rise up above it, but she knows she can't do it. "Come on, maggot Brain, go on maggot brain"This is a reference to her having a miscarriage. The "Maggots" in this song refer to her being pregnant, because she is not able to have her baby. She wants to "rise above it" and " drown in his own shit". The "maggot brain" refers to a part of her body that is unable to get up from the womb. "Mother Earth" is referring to her mother, Mother Earth, and her unborn child. The mother is pregnant because of the pregnancy, and the unborn child is being carried up on her mother's womb. The father is trying to get her out of the womb, but the mother is unable. "I have taste the maggot in my mindOf the universe" is saying that the mother has knocked her down and she is now pregnant. "Maggots" is a metaphor for the mother. "My mother had a baby for the 3rd time for yall, for y'all have knock her up"This refers to the mother having a baby, and then the baby is born. The baby is the mother of the mother, and when she is born, she becomes pregnant again. "The mother earth is pregnant" means that the baby has knocked the mother up, and now she has a new baby. The second verse is about how she has had enough of life, and how she wants to get over it.
Ground Truth: i've heard the same story. it's music history. legend. the kicker is that supposedly eddie was tripping on acid at the time. which as you can imagine would have incredibly amplified the relevence of george clinton's statement. regardless, it's an incredible song and an even more incredible solo. the most tragic, moving, instrumental i've heard in my life. when i listen to this song i can't help but be lifted by it. gaugedangeron February 18, 2006   
Lyrics: Hey dad; I'm writing to you; not to tell you, that I still hate you; just to ask you; how you feel; and how we fell apart; ; how this fell apart; are you happy out there in this great wide world?; do you think about your sons?; do you miss your little girl?; when you lay your head down; how do you sleep at night?; ; do you even wonder if we're all right?; but we're all right; ; we're all right; it's been a long hard road without you by my side; why weren't you there all the nights that we cried; you broke my mother's heart; you broke your children for life; it's not ok; but we're all right; I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes; but those were just a long lost memory of mine; ; I spent so many years learning how to survive; Now, I'm writing just to let you know that I'm still alive; the days I spent so cold, so hungry; were full of hate; I was so angry; those scars run deep inside this tattooed body; ; there's things I'll take, to my grave; but I'm okay; I'm okay; it's been a long hard road without you by my side; why weren't you there all the nights that we cried; you broke my mother's heart; you broke your children for life; it's not ok; but we're all right; I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes; ; but those were just a long lost memory of mine; Now, I'm writing just to let you know that I'm still alive; yeah, I'm still alive; sometimes?; I forgive; ; yeah and this time; I'll admit; that I miss you, said I miss you; it's been a long hard road without you by my side; why weren't you there all the nights that we cried; you broke my mother's heart; you broke your children for life; it's not ok; ; but we're all right; I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes; but those were just a long lost memory of mine; Now, I'm writing just to let you know that were still alive; and sometimes; I forgive; and this time; I'll admit, that I miss you, miss you; hey dad
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has lost his girlfriend. He's writing to her, not to tell her that I still hate you, just to ask her how you feel and how we fell apart. He wants to know how she feels and how he feels about her, but she doesn't want to know. He misses her, she misses him, he misses her. He doesn't know if she's still alive, but he wants her to know that he's still there for her, and that they're all right. He asks her how she's doing, and she asks him how he's doing. She asks him if he's okay. He tells her that he loves her and that he'll miss her. She tells him that she's okay, and he's telling her that she'll always be there for him. She wants him to know she's alright, and to tell him that he will always love her, even if it's just a long distance road. She's asking him how she is doing. He'll tell her how he is doing and how she'll be fine, and then she'll tell him how much he means to her.

Lyrics: I walked across an empty land; I knew the pathway like the back of my hand; I felt the earth beneath my feet; Sat by the river and it made me complete; ; Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?; I'm getting old and I need something to rely on; So tell me when you're gonna let me in; I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin; ; I came across a fallen tree; I felt the branches of it looking at me; Is this the place we used to love?; Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?; ; Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?; I'm getting old and I need something to rely on; So tell me when you're gonna let me in; I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin; ; And if you have a minute why don't we go; Talk about it somewhere only we know?; This could be the end of everything; So why don't we go?; ; Somewhere only we know?; Somewhere only we know?; ; Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?; I'm getting old and I need something to rely on; So tell me when you're gonna let me in; I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin; ; And if you have a minute why don't we go?; Talk about it somewhere only we know; This could be the end of everything; So why don't we go?; So why don't we go?; ; This could be the end of everything; So why don't we go somewhere only we know?; Somewhere only we know; Somewhere only we know
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who loves a girl, but doesn't want to go out with her. He wants to be with her, but he's getting tired of her, and he wants to move on. He's tired of waiting for her to let him in, but she doesn't know where to begin. He knows that he's going to leave, and that he needs to find a place to start over. He asks her when he'll let her in, and she says, "Why don't we go talk about it somewhere only we know?" He wants her to go somewhere only he knows where to start. He also wants to know where she's going, and if she'll let him into her life, and where she'll go. This could be the end of everything, so why don't you go? He's asking her when she's gonna let him back in, because he knows that she'll be with him forever.
Ground Truth: I think this song is about a young adult whose had a terminal illness and has been in and out of hospitals all his life. At one of his rehabilitation centers, he meets a girl with a similar condition and they spend time together in the woods behind one of the rehabilitation centers. He has just been told he has one month to live so he opens the song here: he is looking back at the nostalgia of the good memories of the hope of a normal life and appreciating the simple things in life: like the river, the earth that made him complete. He is getting tired of going in and out of treatment centers and given false hope and now reality sets in. When is the earth going to let him in, meaning opening up a grave under the earth (empty land) so he can now begin to rest in peace. The signs are there: a fallen tree looking at me as if signaling it is his time to pass (live trees are often a symbol of longevity, of vibrant, healthy life, which he doesn't have). He knows of this girl suffering like him and they had some happy times in those woods behind the rehab center and that's where he wants his final resting place to be and wants to ask her to join him as their final resting place so they can both be at peace: no more suffering with treatment after treatment: why don't we go somewhere only we know (no one else in the world would understand their plight of pain and suffering from their terminal illness that is slowly killing them both). He wants to leave this earth on his terms and is asking her if she will join him: this could be the end of everything, so why don't we go somewhere only we know...noentiendoon February 15, 2019   
Lyrics: Yes it's me; I am the one; To make you see; Where we belong; I was shaking; Like a leaf; All wrapped up; In my dirty sheets; If I agree to what comes next; I would be faking; With the best of them; It seems a crime; I would commit; Without the difference; Of all the world's gifts; ; Sweet sweet sweet; Could you taste it; ; Never never never; Never never never; (Taste it); ; To dream; All the time; Without a scream; In the dead of night; All those faces; Come back to me; I'll be begging; To swim that sea; ; Yea I made; A picture story; Make you cry; In all your glory; A need to quench; The thirst of many; To justify; And make ready; ; Sweet sweet sweet; Could you taste it; ; Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; (Taste it); ; This realization; Owes us strength to show; If you're uncertain; You're invited to believe; These are the words I speak; These are the words I speak; ; A dislocation; From where we once came from; Give sons and daughters; Because we want to go on; ; These are the words she speaks; These are the words she speaks; ; Sweet sweet sweet; Could you taste it; ; Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; (Taste it); Never never never; Never never never
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who loves a girl and wants to be with her, but she cant be with him, and she wants to get away from him. "i would be faking with the best of them" i think he is saying that he wants to go on with his life, but he doesn't want to. "I would commit without the difference of all the world's gifts" he is telling her that he would do anything for her, and that he is the one to make her see where she belongs. "if I agree to what comes next" he wants her to see where he belongs, and he is begging her to come back to him. he is trying to convince her that she is the only one for him, that she belongs with him and that she should let him go. "a dislocation from where we once came fromGive sons and daughtersBecause we want to goOn" he's saying that she wants him to leave her behind. "these are the words she speaks" she is telling him that he can't live without her. "this realization Owes us strength to showIf you're uncertainYou're invited to believe" he means that he's not going to give her what she wants, but that she can't give him what he wants. "These are the things I speak" she's saying to him that she loves him and wants him back. "A dislocation" from where he came fromgive sons and girlsBecause we wanna go on" she means that she has a dislocation and she is asking him to let her go because she doesn't know what to do with her life. "the dislocationfrom where we came from" he says that she believes in him and he's asking her to believe that she's the one that can help him get through this. "This dislocationFrom where we used to come from" she says that he wishes he could go on because she's telling him how she feels about him and how she wishes he would go on. "all the timeWithout a screamIn the dead of nightAll those facesCome back to meI'll be begging to swim that sea" she seems to be saying that if he says "all those faces" she'll come back and she'll be asking him if he loves her and if she's going to stay with him. she is saying "all these faces" because he's telling her to swim the sea. "yea I made a picture storyMake you cryIn all your
Ground Truth: Apparently stems from a comment Michael Hutchins made to a band mate after losing his sense of taste and smell regarding never being able to taste or smell his current lover at the time, that is if you believe the tele movie they just showed here in Oz. To be honest I think it has a double meaning one re losing his sense of taste and smell and also the hollow feeling of having casual affairs or being with some one you have no feeling for. It seems that we all chase that elusive feeling of love and the sensation. Of it to me so it makes sense. Michael was a very talented yet abstrAct poet or lyricist. Then again it could all just be random stuff he thought fitted with Andrews music. We will never really know I suppose.

Lyrics: Let's take the boat out on the bay,; Forget your job for just one day; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; It might be inappropriate, because; Either way, our band gets dropped, oh yeah; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; But I'd play with fire to break the ice; And I'd play with a nuclear device; Is it something I'll regret; Why do I want what I can't get?; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; The 3 date theory's getting old; Everyone's getting left out in the cold; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; So I'll see you with another guy; Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; But I'd play with fire to break the ice; And I'd play with a nuclear device; Is it something I'll regret; Why do I want what I can't get?; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; I'll be moving on, moving on, moving on and on; Moving on, moving on, moving on and on and on; But I'd play with fire to break the ice; And I'd play with a nuclear device; Is it something I'll regret; Why do I want what I can't get?; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; I wish it didn't have to be so bad; I wish it didn't have to be so bad
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him. She wants to break up with him, but he's telling her he loves her, and he wants to move on with his life. He's saying that he wishes it didn't have to be so bad, because he doesn't know what to do with her anymore. He wants to make her happy, but doesn't have the courage to let go of the relationship. "I wish it had to have to been so bad." He wishes it could have been so much better. He wishes that he could be with her again, but it's too late. "And I'd play with a nuclear deviceIs it something I'll regret? Why do I want what I can't get?" He's not going to let her go. "Why do I wanna what I cant get." He wants her to realize that she's not the only one who wants to be together. "The 3 date theory's getting oldEveryone's getting left out in the cold." He's asking her to leave him. "Moving on, moving on." He knows she's going to give up on him, and that he'll always be there for her. "So I'll see you with another guyWho pretends not to hear you when you cry." He doesn't care about her anymore, he's just going to stay with her. He'll be moving on and moving on.
Ground Truth: What everyone's said is right. But i like the chorus. It just gives that "feeling", you know? "But Id play with fire to break the iceAnd Id play with a nuclear deviceIs it something Ill regret? Why do I want what I cant get? I wish it didnt have to be so bad "I don't really like Blink, but this song still gets me every time. slugsinthefieldson March 05, 2003   
Lyrics: It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders; It's a terrible love and I'm walking in; It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders; It's a terrible love and I'm walking in; ; Its quiet company; Its quiet company; ; It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders; It's a terrible love and I'm walking in; It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders; It's a terrible love and I'm walking in; ; Its quiet company; Its quiet company; Its quiet company; ; And I can't fall asleep; Without a little help; It takes a while to settle down my shivered bones; Until the panic's out; ; It takes an ocean not to break; It takes an ocean not to break; It takes an ocean not to break; It takes an ocean not to break; ; company; It's quiet company; It's quiet company; It's quiet company; ; And I won't follow you; Into the rabbit hole; I said I would, but then I saw your shivered bones; They didn't want me to; ; It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders; It's a terrible love and I'm walking in; It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders; It's a terrible love and I'm walking in; ; It takes an ocean not to break; It takes an ocean not to break; It takes an ocean not to break
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but can't get over her. he wants to be with her, but she doesn't want him. he's trying to convince her to stay with him, but he can't because she's too scared to. "It takes a while to settle down my shivered bones until the panic's out" is him telling her that she can't fall asleep without him, and she's afraid to fall asleep. "Its quiet company, its quiet company" means that she's scared of what he'll do, and that he's going to do anything to help her. "And I won't follow you into the rabbit hole, I said I would, but then I saw your shivering bones, they didn't want me to" is about him being scared of being with her again, and not being able to get over it. "it takes a long time to calm down my shaking bonesUntil the panic’s out" could mean that he feels like he has no control over her, and he's scared that she won't be able to leave him, because he doesn't know what to do.
Ground Truth: Itï¿½s a terrible loveThat Iï¿½m walking with spidersItï¿½s a terrible love that Iï¿½m walking withItï¿½s a terrible loveThis part is somewhat interesting. He's walking with spiders, and he's walking with ''a terrible love''. He is uneasy about this love, and has been already caught in it's spider web. It's quiet untill he get's caught. That's what I think. The rest just mentions how he feels uneasy, ''it takes an ocean not to break'' -- He can't just let it go, he gives in. That's what I think. All in all, excellent song. writer105on January 27, 2011   
Lyrics: Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes; I can barely define the shape of this moment in time; And far from flying high in clear blue skies; I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide; ; If you negotiate the minefield in the drive; And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes; And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall; Dial the combination, open the priesthole; And if I'm in I'll tell you; ; There's a kid who had a big hallucination; Making love to girls in magazines; He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith; Could anybody love him or is it just a crazy dream; ; And if I show you my dark side; Will you still hold me tonight?; And if I open my heart to you; And show you my weak side; What would you do?; Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?; Would you take the children away and leave me alone?; And smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phone; Would you send me packing or would you take me home?; ; Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings; Thought I oughta tear the curtain down; I held the blade in trembling hands; Prepared to make it, but; Just then the phone rang; I never had the nerve to make the final cut
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who's been in love with a girl for a long time, but never had the nerve to make the final cut. He's in a relationship with this girl, but he doesn't know if she loves him or not. It's like he's trying to get her to believe that he loves her, but she's scared, and she's afraid to tell him, because he's scared to tell her. "And if I show you my dark sideWill you still hold me tonight? And if I open my heart to youAnd show you, my weak sideWhat would you doWould you sell your story to Rolling StoneWould you take the children away and leave me aloneAnd smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phoneWould you send me packingOr would you take me home? Thought I oughta bare my naked feelingsThought I Oughta tear the curtain downI held the blade in trembling handsPrepared to make itBut just then the phone rangI never had a nerveTo make the Final Cut"He's asking her if she'll let him go, and if she's willing to give him what he needs, he'll tell her that he'll take her home, and that he's going to do it.
Ground Truth: The video seems to focus on women that made the difference throughout history. You see women helping the war effort, women nursing, playing sports, Marylin Munroe etc. Since this song refers to Waters break up with his wife Caroline the video could emphasis the fact that for all the 'crappy' women out there are twice as many who will be remembered for the right things.

Lyrics: Ba ba da da, ba ba da da; Ba ba da da, ba ba da da, ba ba da da; ; Take a look at my girlfriend; She's the only one I got; (Ba ba da da); Not much of a girlfriend; I never seem to get a lot; ; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da); ; It's been some time since we last spoke; This is gonna sound like a bad joke; But momma I fell in love again; It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend; ; And I know it sounds so old; But cupid got me in a chokehold; And I'm afraid I might give in; Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin'; ; I mean she even cooks me pancakes; And Alka Seltzer when my tummy aches; If that ain't love then I don't know what love is; ; We even got a secret handshake; And she loves the music that my band makes; I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun; I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da); ; Take a look at my girlfriend; She's the only one I got; (Ba ba da da); Not much of a girlfriend; I never seem to get a lot; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da); ; Take a look at my girlfriend; She's the only one I got; (Ba ba da da); Not much of a girlfriend; I never seem to get a lot; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da); ; It's been a while since we talked last; And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast; But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one; Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son; ; And I know you heard the last song; About the girls that didn't last long; But I promise this is on a whole new plane; I can tell by the way she says my name; (Ba ba da da); ; I love it when she calls my phone; She even got her very own ringtone; If that ain't love then I don't know what love is; (Ba ba da da); ; It's gonna be a long drive home; But I know as soon as I arrive home; And I open the door, take off my coat; And throw my bag on the floor; She'll be back into my arms once more for sure, like; ; Take a look at my girlfriend; She's the only one I got; (Ba ba da da); Not much of a girlfriend; I never seem to get a lot; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da); ; She's got a smile that? ll make the most senile; Annoying old man bite his tongue, I'm not done; She's got eyes comparable to sunrise; And it doesn't stop there, man I swear; She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten; And now she's even got her own song but movin' on; She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard; And we can be on the phone for three hours, not sayin' one word; And I would still cherish every moment; And when I start to build my future she's the main component; Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love or whatever you call it; But everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like; Take a look at my girlfriend; She's the only one I got; (Ba ba da da); Not much of a girlfriend; I never seem to get a lot; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da); Take a look at my girlfriend; She's the only one I got; (Ba ba da da); Not much of a girlfriend; I never seem to get a lot; (Ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
Sample outputs: I love this song. I think it's about a guy who's in love with a girl, but he's not ready to be with her. He's trying to convince himself that he's still in love and that he'll always be there for her, even though he knows it's going to be a long drive home.
Ground Truth: no you're not the only one who thinks its about more than one girl..the guy is with one girl and he thinks "he loves her" but in the end it wasnt love. He meets a new girl and feels like he's in love right away...than the last girl is the one he's actually in love withfatty09on February 12, 2008   
Lyrics: Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens; Wipe my nose, get my new boots on; I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter; I put my hand in my father's glove; ; I run off where the drifts get deeper; Sleeping Beauty trips me with a frown; I hear a voice, "You must learn to stand up; For yourself 'cause I can't always be around"; ; He says, when you gonna make up your mind?; When you gonna love you as much as I do?; When you gonna make up your mind?; 'Cause things are gonna change so fast; All the white horses are still in bed; I tell you that I'll always want you near; You say that things change, my dear; ; Boys get discovered as winter melts; Flowers competing for the sun; Years go by and I'm here still waiting; Withering where some snowman was; ; Mirror, mirror, where's the crystal palace?; But I only can see myself; Skating around the truth who I am; But I know, Dad, the ice is getting thin; ; When you gonna make up your mind?; When you gonna love you as much as I do?; When you gonna make up your mind?; 'Cause things are gonna change so fast; All the white horses are still in bed; I tell you that I'll always want you near; You say that things change, my dear; ; Hair is grey and the fires are burning; So many dreams on the shelf; You say I wanted you to be proud of me; I always wanted that myself; ; When you gonna make up your mind?; When you gonna love you as much as I do?; When you gonna make up your mind?; 'Cause things are gonna change so fast; All the white horses have gone ahead; I tell you that I'll always want you near; You say that things change, my dear; ; Never change; ; All the white horses aah-aah; Mmm-mmm
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy who is always waiting for her to make it up to him. "He says when you gonna make up your mindWhen you gonna love you as much as I do"I think it's saying that she wants him to be proud of her, but she knows that she will never be able to be happy with him.
Ground Truth: i love this song even though my father was an alcoholic he was a really good father and i learned all those things from him i really learned to love myself as much as he did. "You say I wanted you to be proud of meI always wanted that myself"- i think he is the only one who really showed that he is proud of me because he saw the real me even though i made mistakes.im more connected to my mom but this song connects me with him in a strange way-this is such a beautiful song. springhazeon April 10, 2009

Lyrics: I'm taking a ride with my best friend; I hope he never lets me down again; He knows where he's taking me; Taking me where I want to be; I'm taking a ride with my best friend; We're flying high; We're watching the world pass us by; Never want to come down; Never want to put my feet back down on the ground; I'm taking a ride with my best friend; I hope he never lets me down again; Promises me I'm as safe as houses; As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers; I hope he never lets me down again; We're flying high; We're watching the world pass us by; Never want to come down; Never want to put my feet back down on the ground; We're flying high; We're watching the world pass us by; Never want to come down; Never want to put my feet back down on the ground; Never let me down; Never let me down; Never let me down; Never let me down; Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright); Never let me down (everything's alright tonight); Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright); Never let me down (everything's alright tonight); Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright); Never let me down (everything's alright tonight); Never let me down (see the stars, they're shining bright); Never let me down (everything's alright tonight)
Sample outputs: This song is about a girl who is in love with her best friend, but he doesn't want to let her down. He wants her to know that he loves her, and that he will always be there for her even if she doesn't feel the same way about him. She wants to be with him, but she knows that he won't let her go. She doesn't know if he'll ever let her let him down, and she hopes that he never lets her down again. He knows where he's taking me,Taking me where I want to beI'm taking a ride with my best friendWe're flying highWe're watching the world pass us byNever wanna come downNever want to put my feet back down on the groundI think this song is talking about a guy who loves her and doesn't care if she's with him or not. She's waiting for him to come back. She hopes that she'll never let him go.
Ground Truth: For me, there are two interpretations to this song. One is the obvious drug reference, which makes a lot of sense through the contents and imagery. The other, and I'm surprised no one has actually spelled it out so far (a few ppl did hint at this but very vaguely) is the very obvious BDSM references. I’m surprised because DM have such an orientation towards this subject (Master and Servants, Behind the Wheel, and many more) - how come no one mentioned it here earlier? I find the lyrics can make sense talking about a BDSM session or relationship: The “friend” in control, taking his sub to where he wants/needs to be. Also the euphoric feeling can of course relate to the famous state called “sub space”, which is supposed to be very similar to a drug high. Since this sort of power exchange demands a very high level of trust (when you surrender yourself into the hands of another), being let down by the trusted Dominant can be a very painful experience, and you sure would hope that he doesn’t let you down again this time, on this ride you’re taking with him. And then there’s the line about being safe as houses, as long as you remember who’s in control…That’s pretty obvious and quite a few ppl mentioned that line as to do with control and power exchange. I like both interpretations a lot, even though I do admit the BDSM one is a bit of a stretch…Still thought it was worth mentioning, just to play with the idea *smiles*I'd love to hear what ppl think about this one!

Lyrics: The devil on my shoulder tells me he's proud of me; That it takes a real man to look out for himself and no one else; I don't want to believe that; But sometimes it's easier to just stay silent; ; I wish I knew how to speak out; I never had a problem with words; But only when talking to someone else; There's a war inside me that's all my own; And I need to talk like a king to keep myself afloat; But how much longer until everyone knows?; ; There's a war inside me that's all my own; There's a war inside me that's all my own; ; I should have started to take my own advice; From the moment that I started giving it; But I can only control what happens from here; And if none of this had happened; Then I couldn't have heard...; ; The angel on my shoulder tells me he's proud of me; That it takes a real man to live for everyone else before himself; I know I believe it; And it'll never get easier; But it will always be worth it; ; There's a war inside me that's all my own; ; I'm still learning to speak out against myself; And stay on the path I truly want to be on; Though I've lost my way more times that I have wished; My heart is constant and willing; ; I still believe that we were made for more; That what I've been doing lately; This end of depression will be the start of getting back what I have lost; Because I had become conceited; But I'm making it back to where I last left off; And so I've shown you my heart; Will you restore me?
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who has been through a lot of bad things in his life and he wants to come out of it, but he can't because he doesn't want to be hurt. The devil on my shoulder tells me he's proud of meThat it takes a real man to look out for himself and no one elseI don't wanna believe thatBut sometimes it's easier to just stay silentI wish I knew how to speak outI never had a problem with wordsBut only when talking to someone elseThere's a war inside meThat's all my ownAnd I need to talk like a kingTo keep myself afloatBut how much longer until everyone knows? There's a War inside me That's All My OwnI should have started to take my own adviceFrom the moment that I started giving itBut I can only control what happens from hereAnd if none of this had happenedThen I couldn't have heard. The angel on my shoulders tells me that's all My OwnAnd I think that's what he's saying. He's saying that he's not perfect, and he's trying to make it back to where he was before he became conceited but he's making it back where he last left offAnd so I've shown you my heartWill you restore me? I'm still learningTo speak out against myselfAnd stay on the path I truly want toBe onThough I've lost my way more times that I have wishedMy heart is constant and willingI still believe that we were made for moreThat what I've been doing latelyThis end of depression will be the start of getting back what I have lostBecause I had become conceitedBut I'm making itBack to where I last leftOffSo I've show you my heartsWill you restored me?
Ground Truth: he's trying to change his ways and walk the right path, the path of God, but hes constantly at war with his old self, conceited and self serving. he's learning to stand up to his old self, and realizes that if it werent for his actions it would not have led to him realizing that he is lost. he has always done what he told himself was the right thing to do, and has no problem bragging and preaching to others, all instead of looking to God for guidance. the angel and devil are illustrated amazingly on the album cover, along with the crown. "and it'll never get easier,but it will always be worth it"AMAZING lyricsthis song really defines what im going through in my life right now, and these guys hit the nail right on the head.
Lyrics: It starts with; One thing I don't know why; It doesn't even matter how hard you try; Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme; To explain in due time; ; All I know; Time is a valuable thing; Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings; Watch it count down to the end of the day; The clock ticks life away; ; It's so unreal; It's so unreal, didn't look out below; Watch the time go right out the window; Tryna hold on, did-didn't even know; I wasted it all just to watch you go; ; Watch you go; I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart; What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard; ; I tried so hard; And got so far; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; I had to fall; To lose it all; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; ; One thing, I don't know why; It doesn't even matter how hard you try; Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme; To remind myself how I tried so hard; ; I tried so hard; In spite of the way you were mockin' me; Acting like I was part of your property; Remembering all the times you fought with me; I'm surprised it got so far; ; Got so far; Things aren't the way they were before; You wouldn't even recognize me anymore; Not that you knew me back then; But it all comes back to me in the end; ; In the end; You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart; What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard; ; I tried so hard; And got so far; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; I had to fall; To lose it all; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; ; I've put my trust in you; Pushed as far as I can go; For all this; There's only one thing you should know; ; I've put my trust in you; Pushed as far as I can go; For all this; There's only one thing you should know; ; I tried so hard; And got so far; But in the end; It doesn't even matter; I had to fall; To lose it all; But in the end; It doesn't even matter
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who was in love with a girl, but the girl left him. The guy was trying to get over her, but he just couldn't get her back, and he couldn't take it anymore. He felt like he had to let go of her, and it didn't matter how hard he tried, because in the end it doesn't even matter.
Ground Truth: I LOVE this song. I think it's about how anyone in general tries so hard to get something, and even though they were so close they couldn't keep it apart. So much personal meaning..chelsbels105on June 02, 2010   
Lyrics: If you want to open the hole; Just put your head down and go; Step beside the piece of circumstance; Got to wash away the taste of evidence; ; Wash it away; ; (Evidence... Evidence... Evidence... got a taste of evidence); ; I didn't feel a thing; You didn't mean a thing; Look in the eye and testify; It didn't feel a thing; ; Anything you say, we know you're guilty; Hands above your head and you won't even feel me; ; You won't feel me; ; (I didn't feel a thing); ; I didn't feel a thing; It didn't mean a thing; Look in the eye and testify;; I didn't feel a thing; ; (Evidence... Evidence... Evidence... got a taste of evidence); ; I didn't feel a thing; You didn't mean a thing; Look in the eye and testify; It didn't feel a thing; ; I didn't feel a thing; You didn't mean a thing; Look in the eye and testify; It didn't feel a thing
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has an affair with a girl, but he doesn't feel the same way about her. He doesn't want her to know that he's cheating on her, but she won't even feel him. "Anything you say, we know you're guiltyHands above your headAnd you won’t even feel meYou won't feel meI didn't feel a thingYou didn't mean a thingLook in the eye and testifyIt didn't seem a thingAnything you doWe know you’re guiltyComes above your heads and you won'tEven feel me"I think it's about a girl who doesn't really care about him, and he's trying to convince her that he didn't want to hurt her. "If you want to open the holeJust put your head down and goStep beside the piece of circumstanceGot to wash away the taste of evidenceWash it away"He's telling her that she didn't hurt him, that he wasn't hurting her, and that he was just trying to make her feel better. "evidence... evidence... got a taste of Evidence"He wants her to believe that he did hurt her, that it didn't matter what she did, because he's not going to let her do it. "I Didn't Feel A ThingYou Didn't Mean A ThingLook in The Eye And testifyIt Didn't Seem A Thing"He feels guilty, and she's telling him that she doesn't mean anything to him, because she's guilty of what he's done, so he's going to tell her what he did to her, to show her that it wasn't what she thought it was, that she wasn't hurt. "Everything you say we knowYou're guiltyCands above Your HeadAnd You Won't Even Feel MeYou Won't Feel Me"He doesn't know how she feels about him. He's talking about how she's been hurt, and how he won't let it go. "Something you sayWe know You're GuiltyHands Above Your Head and You won't EvenFeel Me"This is him telling her he's guilty, but it won't happen. "We won't know me"It's about how he'll let her know how he feels about her, even though he knows that she's hurt him.
Ground Truth: I also think it's about cheating, but I've also always had another interpretation: someone was hired to do something that no one is supposed to find out, like killing someone, or having sex for money, etc, and (s)he's trying to be cold-blooded about it, but in the end (s)he does feel guilty about it. javier138on March 21, 2011   
Lyrics: We passed upon the stair; We spoke of was and when; Although I wasn't there; He said I was his friend; Which came as some surprise; I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone; A long long time ago"; ; Oh no, not me; I never lost control; You're face to face; With the man who sold the world; ; I laughed and shook his hand; And made my way back home; I searched for form and land; For years and years I roamed; I gazed a gazely stare, at all the millions here; We must have died alone; A long long time ago; ; Who knows? Not me; We never lost control; You're face to face; With the man who sold the world; ; Who knows? Not me; We never lost control; You're face to face; With the man who sold the world
Sample outputs: I don't think this song is about drugs. I think it's more about a man who is trying to convince a woman that he is the man for her. He's telling her that he's not the man she thought he was, and that she's the man who sold the world. I'm not sure if this is right or not, but I think that it's about a woman who was in love with a man, and he's trying to get her to believe in him, but she doesn't believe him.
Ground Truth: and thats not true sk8er (neato name btw)!! heheheBowie truly does have one of the best imaginations out there and also, just because something comes to you when you're high doesn't discredit it at alllaocoonon February 28, 2006

Lyrics: Hey, Nikita is it cold; In your little corner of the world; You could roll around the globe; And never find a warmer soul to know; ; Oh, I saw you by the wall; Ten of your tin soldiers in a row; With eyes that looked like ice on fire; The human heart a captive in the snow; ; Oh, Nikita you will never know,; anything about my home; I'll never know how good it feels to hold you; Nikita I need you so; Oh, Nikita is the other side; of any given line in time; Counting ten tin soldiers in a row; Oh no, Nikita you'll never know; ; Do you ever dream of me; Do you ever see the letters that I write; When you look up through the wire; Nikita do you count the stars at night; ; And if there comes a time; Guns and gates no longer hold you in; And if you're free to make a choice; Just look towards the west and find a friend; ; Oh, Nikita you will never know,; anything about my home; I'll never know how good it feels to hold you; Nikita I need you so; Oh, Nikita is the other side; of any given line in time; Counting ten tin soldiers in a row; Oh no, Nikita you'll never know; ; Oh, Nikita you will never know, never know anything about my home; I'll never know how good it feels to hold you; Nikita I need you so; Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time; Counting ten tin soldiers in a row; Oh no, Nikita you'll never know; Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row; Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row; Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row; Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a man who is afraid to tell her about his feelings for her. She is afraid that she will never be able to tell him about her feelings for him. "Hey Nikita you will never know anything about my homeI'll never know how good it feels to hold youNikita I need you soOh Nikita is the other side of any given line in timeCounting ten tin soldiers in a rowOh noNikita you'll never never knowDo you ever see the letters that I writeWhen you look up through the wireNikita do you count the stars at nightAnd if there comes a timeGuns and gates no longer hold you inAnd if you're free to make a choiceJust look towards the west and find a friend"I think that means that she is afraid of losing him, but she is willing to do anything to be with him.
Ground Truth: aww well this song is the reason i was named naquita ...its pronounced nikita but yea spellt it differently to give it some originality ....from y=the time i was a wee las people use to just meet me nd start singing this song (i guess they saw it as an ice braker it just makes things awkward if u ask me)loldefinatly a deep songpuppyloveon July 06, 2006   
Lyrics: I am walking; out in the rain; and I am listening to the low moan; of the dial tone again; and I am getting; nowhere with you; and I can't let it go; and I can't get through...; ; The old woman behind the pink curtains; and the closed door; on the first floor; she's listening through the air shaft; to see how long our swan song can last; ; And both hands; now use both hands; oh, no don't close your eyes; I am writing; graffitti on your body; I am drawing the story of; how hard we tried; ; I am watching your chest rise and fall; like the tides of my life,; and the rest of it all; and your bones have been my bedframe; and your flesh has been my pillow; I am waiting for sleep; to offer up the deep; with both hands; Oh! both hands; ; And in each other's shadows we grew less and less tall; and eventually our theories couldn't explain it all; and I'm recording our history now on the bedroom wall; and when we leave the landlord will come; and paint over it all; ; And I am walking; out in the rain; and I am listening to the low moan of the dial tone again; and I am getting nowhere with you; and I can't let it go; and I can't get though; So now use both hands; please use both hands; oh, no don't close your eyes; I am writing graffitti on your body; I am drawing the story of how hard we tried; hard we tried; how hard we tried
Sample outputs: I think this song is about two people who are in love with each other, but they don't want to let it go. They want to be together, but it's not working out. The old woman behind the pink curtains and the closed door on the first floorShe's listening through the air shaftTo see how long our swan song can lastAnd both handsNow use both handsOh no don't close your eyesI am writing graffitti on your bodyI am drawing the story of how hard we triedI am watching your chest rise and fallLike the tides of my lifeAnd the rest of it allAnd your bones have been my bedframeAnd your flesh has been my pillowI am waiting for sleepTo offer up the deepWith both hands Oh! both handsAnd in each other's shadowsWe grew less and less tallAnd eventually our theories couldn't explain it allI'm recording our history now on the bedroom wallAnd when we leave the landlord will come and paint over it alland I am walking out in the rain and I am listening to the low moan of the dial tone againAnd I am getting nowhere with youAnd I can't let it goesAnd I cant get thoughSo now use both handOh no, don't open your eyesAnd I'm recording your historyNow on my bedroom walland when we leaves the landlordWill comeAnd paint overIt allAnd I think this means that he's recording his past, but he can't get it out of his head. He's recording it on his bedroom wall, because he's afraid he'll be leaving the house and the landlord won't be able to get over it. And he's also recording his history now, because when we left the landlord, they'll come and spray over it...I think he's saying that he doesn't want the landlord to leave the house, so he's trying to get out of the house. I think it's also saying that when he leaves the house he'll have to paint over everything that's happened. And I am watching you chest rise & fall like the tidesOf my life and the rest Of It Alland your bones and my bed frameand your flesh and your flesh have been his pillowI think that means that the bones and flesh in his bedframe are the bones of his bones and the flesh is the flesh of his pillow, and that the flesh has
Ground Truth: I think this is open for interpretation. I have always related it to when I was in love. We lived together. That apartment was ours and our love was all over the place. Passion was never lacking. "Eventually our theories couldn't explain it all." It didn't work out. I would have painted it all over the walls. I know I cried it out so hard, that if the walls could talk they'd tell my story. We will always deny each other, but whenever we'd have sex.. it was love. He used both hands.

Lyrics: . . .; Oh, yeah . . .; . . .; These are the days of the open hand; They will not be the last; Look around now; These are the days of the beggars and; the choosers; This is the year of the hungry man; Whose place is in the past; Hand in hand with; ignorance; And, legitimate excuses; The rich declare themselves poor; And, most of us are not sure; If we have too much; But, we'll take our chances; Cause God's stopped keeping score; I guess somewhere along the way; He must have let us all out to play; Turned his back and; all god's children; Crept out the back door; And, it's hard to love,; there's so much to hate; Hanging on to hope; When there is no hope to speak of; And, the wounded skies above; say it's much too much; too late; . . .; Well maybe we should all; be praying for time; . . . .; . . . .; These are the days of the empty hand; Oh, you hold on to what you can; And, charity is a coat you wear; twice a year; This is the year of the guilty man; Your television takes a stand; And, you find; that what was over there; is over here; So, you scream from behind your door; Say what's mine is mine and; not yours; I may have too much; but, I'll take my chances; 'Cause God's stopped keeping score; And, you cling to the things they sold you; Did you cover your eyes when they told you; That he can't come back; Because, he has no children; to come back for; It's hard to love; there's so much to hate; Hanging on to hope; when there is no hope; to speak of; And, the wounded skies above; say it's much too late; So, maybe we should all; be praying for time . . .; . . .; Woh, yeah . . .
Sample outputs: This song is about how the world is corrupt, and how we need to stop living in the past and live in the present. It's about how we are not sure if we have too much, but we'll take our chances, cause God's stopped keeping score, and they will not be the lastLook around now, these are the days of the beggars and the choosersThis is the year of the hungry manWhose place is in a pastHand in hand with ignoranceAnd legitimate excusesThe rich declare themselves poorAnd most of us are notsureIf we have to muchBut we'll Take our chancesCause God's stop keeping scoreI guess somewhere along the wayHe must have let us all out to playTurned his back and all god's childrenCrept out the back doorAnd it's hard to love, there's so much to hateHanging on to hopeWhen there is no hope to speak ofAnd the wounded skies aboveSay it's much too lateSo maybe we should all be praying for timeAnd you cling to the things they sold youDid you cover your eyes when they told youThat he can't come backBecause he has no childrenTo come back forIt's hard enough to love there's too much to loveHanging onto to hope when there's no hopeTo speak ofand the wounded sky above say it'sMuch too lateI may have tooMuchBut I'll take my chancesCause god's stopped keepin score, I guess somewhereAlong the way, he must've let us see all the people he sold youAnd charity is a coat you wear twice a yearThis is a year of a guilty manYour television takes a standAnd you find that what was over there is over hereSo you scream from behind your doorSay what's mine is mine and not yoursI may be too much but I'll Take my chances'Cause God is stopping keeping scoreAnd You cling to what you canAnd Charity is a Coat you wearTwice a yearIt's a yearOf the guilty manyour television take a standand you findthat what wasover there isover hereSo, you screamFrom behind your doorsSay what’s mine is yours and not yourI may am too muchBut I’ll Take My ChanceCause God’S Stop Keeping Score, And you clingTo the things that sold you, Did you cover my eyes when you told youthat he can’t come back because he hasNo children to come backforIt's harder to loveThere is so much
Ground Truth: Well, the song was a number one hit. But it's the nature of the song that might make one think that. It sort of has its place, but it's not something you hear on the radio every day. Aswell the fact that George Michael refused to appear in a video for the song. The lyrics encompass the song's message so effectively, that I don't think a video would have been a particularly good idea anyway. The song is, thankfully, not about a particular event, but sort of a commentary on the state of the world, the culture, and the media's effect on us. He says this is the year of the guitly man, where the television takes its stand. I may be wrong, but based off of what Michael's sad, aswell as my own interpetation, I think it's about the media programming us to believe things are a certain way, and we are guilted in various ways - always as a way to get into our pockets, or make us go along with something. He says charity is a coat you wear twice a year. Charity is a fashionable thing to do, and everyone will dress up for the occasion once or twice a year, but is change in their hearts? Do they truly care or understand the full gravity of the world's plight? Maybe what is over there is also over here, but they don't at all realize it. We are mesmerized and distracted, distracted by the things we must obtain before it's too late. We're hiding behind our posessions, our faux sense of security, so we scream from behind our doors with a defensive scream to the world outside. We cling to the things they sold us because, afterall, God stopped keeping score. God comes into the story quite interestingly. My interpretation is that God, not knowing what was to occur, turned his back for a moment, and his children (possibly Adam and Eve, if you like) crept out the back door, out of touch, and became lost in the world and its darknesses. It is as if we've made such a mess of everything, that God stopped keeping tabs on who's doing what. And he won't return because he has no one to come back for. Of course, it only seems that this is the c
Lyrics: The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land; Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky; A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers; But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking; ; He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise; In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise; He's chained forever to a world that's departed; It's not enough, it's not enough; ; His blood has frozen and curdled with fright; His knees have trembled and given way in the night; His hand has weakened at the moment of truth; His step has faltered; ; One world, one soul; Time pass, the river roll; ; And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication; And silent replies that swirl invitation; Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea; A grim intimation of what is to be; ; There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night; And there's dust in my eyes that blinds my sight; And silence that speaks so much louder than words; Of promises broken
Sample outputs: I think this song is about the loss of a loved one, and how it is hard for him to be able to move on from that love. "The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the landPlumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden skyA man lies and dreams of green fields and riversBut awakes to a morning with no reason for wakingHe's haunted by the memory of a lost paradiseIn his youth or a dream, he can't be preciseHe's chained forever to a world that's departedIt's not enough, it’s not enoughHis blood has frozen and curdled with frightHis knees have trembled and given way in the nightHis hand has weakened at the moment of truthHis step has falteredOne world, one soulTime pass, the river rollAnd he talks to the river of lost love and dedicationAnd silent replies that swirl invitationFlow dark and troubled to an oily seaA grim intimation of what is to beThere's an unceasing wind that blows through this nightAnd there's dust in my eyes that blinds my sightAnd silence that speaks so much louder than wordsOf promises broken"He's trying to convince himself that he's not alone, and he doesn't want to be alone, but he knows that he is.
Ground Truth: Does it has something to do with "High hopes"? Both songs talks about (i think) the same scenery, for example in "high hopes" the grass which was greener, the endless river, and here in "sorrow" it may be talking about the person who is talking about the things we hear in "high hopes" :"a man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers""He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise""And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication"what do you think? eva_floydon January 12, 2007   
Lyrics: Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat and gets caught; These broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost; In trying so hard to look away from you; We followed white lines to the sunset; I crash my car everyday the same way; ; Time to let this pass; (the time it takes, the time it takes to let go); Time runs through our veins; (it starts and stops and starts and stops again); We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time; (the time it takes, the time it takes to let go); Time to let this pass; (the time it takes, the time it takes to let go); ; Staring at the setting sun; No reason to come back again; The twlight world in blue and white; The needle and the damage done; ; I don't want to feel this way forever; A dead letter marked return to sender; ; Broken watch you gave me turns into compass; It's two hands still point to the same time 12: 03, our last goodbye; ; So push the seats back a little further; I can see the headlights coming; So push the seats back a little further; Roll the windows down and take a breath; I can see the headlights coming; They paint the world in red and broken glass; ; Time to let this pass; (the time it takes, the time it takes to let go); Time runs through our veins; (it starts and stops and starts and stops again); We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time; (the time it takes, the time it takes to let go); Time to let this pass; (the time it takes, the time it takes to let go); ; Staring at the setting sun; No reason to come back again; The twlight world in blue and white; The needle and the damage done; ; I don't want to feel this way forever; A dead letter marked return to sender; ; The spinning hubcaps set the tempo for the music of a broken window; With the cameras on the cameras click; We open up the lens and can't stop; ; Staring at the setting sun; No reason to come back again; The twlight world in blue and white; The needle and the damage done; ; I don't want to feel this way forever; ; When the lights are on the cameras click; We open up the lens to broken glass; (and it's over in a flash); ; Staring at the setting sun; No reason to come back again; The twlight world in blue and white; The needle and the damage done; ; I don't want to feel this way forever; A dead letter marked return to sender; ; (I'll never understand,; Understanding in a car crash); ; In a crash
Sample outputs: I think this song is about someone who has died and is trying to let go of it. "Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat and gets caughtThese broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lostIn trying so hard to look away from youWe followed white lines to the sunsetI crash my car everyday the same wayTime to let this pass (the time it takes, the time it take to let it pass)Time runs through our veins(it starts and stops and starts again)We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time(the time, it takes the time to let let go)Staring at the setting sunNo reason to come back againThe twlight world in blue and whiteThe needle and the damage doneI don't want to feel this way foreverA dead letter marked return to senderBroken watch you gave me turns into compassIt's two hands still point to the same time 12: 03, our last goodbyeSo push the seats back a little furtherI can see the headlights comingSo drive the windows down and take a breath(I think he's talking about the fact that the lights are on and they paint the world in red and broken glass)I think the song is talking about how the person is in a car accident and they want to get out of the car and get away from it, but they can't because they're afraid of the lights coming. "The spinning hubcaps set the tempo for the music of a broken windowWith the cameras on the cameras clickWe open up the lens to broken glassAnd it's over in a flash"He's saying that they don't have a reason to go back to the car, and they just want to keep going, and that they're scared of what's going to happen to them, so they're not going to stay in the car anymore. "Staring At The Setting SunNoReason to come Back AgainThe twLight world in Blue and WhiteThe needle And the damage Done"The person is saying that the car crash is a metaphor for the way the world is, and how it's not worth living. "I'll never understand, Understanding in a Car CrashIn a crashIn a car crash"This person is telling the person that they are going to die, but the person doesn't know what to do about it, and the person knows that it's a bad thing, and it's the only way they'll survive.
Ground Truth: maybe it was intended for a freind who dieded in a car crash. But Thursday has a Aproach to many thing in the same manner that tool does. Look beyond the Obvious. This song, to me, is about the preservarance of the human soul. Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat …gets caughtbroken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lostIn trying so hard to look away from youwe followed white lines to the sunsetI crash my car everyday the same way ( here he implies that he has spent his days as a kid in a fight for something and that he has entered a endless,meaningless cycle of pain and suffering of which he cant ecscape beacause of it.) Time to let this pass(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Time runs through our veins. (It starts it stops it starts and stops again)We don't stand a chance in this threadbare time(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)Time to let this pass(the time it takes, the time it takes to let go)(here he implies that he has to change his ways to save his sanity, and at his current state of mind he is vary unstable("we dont stand a chance in this threadbare"time")Staring at the setting sunNo reason to come back againThe twilight world in blue and whiteThe needle and the damage done(here he states that he has lost all happiness and his world has been plunged into darkness, and he fears that the damge can never be undone)I don’t want to feel this way foreverA dead letter marked return to sender(he cant take it anymore, everything he has tried to rid this feeling is still their)The broken watch you gave me turns into a compassThose two hands still point to the same time 12:03, our last goodbye(someone that he lost{which ties in with the fact it REALLY is about him loseing someone in a carcrash} has givin him something that was so insugnificant when he had it and now he looks to it in comfort, only to find it leads him back to memories of the lost person)So push the seats back a little furtherI can see the headlights comingSo push the seats back a little furtherRoll the

Lyrics: Kill the lights; ; Hello ladies and gentlemen; I'm glad you've graced me with your presence; You're in time to see me wrestle with my conscience; Staring into the si-si-silence; ; You see I came to save the stage; I hope I'm not too late; Passion called from back; Behind the curtain screaming; ; "Sonny, this is urgent; Fill these 50 voices with a purpose; But don't just give it away; Inspiration isn't cheap these days; You better make them earn it"; ; You better; Make them earn it; Make them earn it; ; You better; Make them earn it; Make them earn it; ; Hello ladies and gentlemen; I'm glad you've graced me with your presence; You're in time to see me wrestle with my conscience; Staring in the si-si-silence; ; You see I came to save the stage; I hope I'm not too late; Passion called from back behind the curtain screaming; "Sonny, this is urgent"; ; You see I came to save the stage; I hope I'm not too late; Passion called from back behind the curtain screaming; "Sonny, this is urgent"; How do I address a letter to my generation?; "Sonny", she said, "Save yourself from postage"; How do I address a letter to my generation?; "Sonny", she said, "Sing it in person"
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl and he wants to be with her, but he doesn't know how to do it, so he tells her to "save yourself from postage" so he can do it in person. He wants to make her happy, but she doesn't want him to be happy, because he's too caught up in the fame and fame to be able to do anything about it, and he's trying to convince her that he's not the only one who wants to do something about it. The line "You better make them earn it" reminds me of the line "how do I address a letter to my generation?" I think this line is about how he wants her to know that he is the one who's going to save the stage, and that he needs her to give him the money he needs to make them happy.
Ground Truth: i think this song is about the band's attitude to their live show. the "inspiration isn't cheap these days you better make them earn it" means that there telling theirselves to play their asses off to make the crowd leave with something special. TwiztedTom182on March 20, 2005   
Lyrics: I've never seen the Northern lights,; I've never seen the snow; I never walked across the ice; I ignore the ocean's flow; ; Where I'm born is where I'll die; Where I live is where I cry; ; My children left on a cold night; My husband said it's how things go; Like rabbits blinded by the light; Kids want a better place to grow; ; Where I'm born is where I'll die; At night I shiver and I try; To forget that I never cheated; That I tried to be strong; No matter how wise I was, I feel wrong; To forget that I never followed; That man that I adored; Who promised me pretty sins and gold; ; And I'm waiting for the sun; And I'm waiting for the sun; ; I will never be out of sight; I'll never feel the snow; I'll never reach the truth of lies; I'm just watching my flowers grow; ; Where I'm born is where I'll die; At night I can't sleep when I try; To forget that I never cheated; That I tried to be strong; No matter how wise I was, I feel wrong; To forget that I never followed; That man that I adored; Who promised me pretty sins and gold; ; And I'm waiting for the sun; And I'm waiting for the sun; ; To forget that I never cheated; When I tried to be strong; No matter how wise I was, I feel wrong; To forget that I never followed; That man that I adored; Who promised me pretty sins and gold; ; And I'm waiting for the sun; And I'm waiting for the sun
Sample outputs: This song is about a man who is waiting for the sun to come, to show him that he's not alone, he's waiting for it to come. "I'll never be out of sight, I'll never feel the snow, I will never reach the truth of lies, I'm just watching my flowers grow." This is about how he can't sleep when he tries to forget that he never cheated, and that he is just watching his flowers grow. "At night I shiver and I try, To forget that I never cheated. I tried to be strong, no matter how wise I was, I feel wrong, to forget the man that I adored, who promised me pretty sins and gold." This part is about when he was younger, he was just watching the flowers grow, and he was waiting for his father to come to him, and when he did, he didn't want to be left alone, so he tried to forget about his father, but he couldn't. "And I'm waiting for my sun, and I'm waitin' for the Sun." He is waiting to see his father again, to know that he will always be there for him, even if he doesn't love him anymore. "Where I'm born is where I'll die, at night I cant sleep when I try." This line is about him trying to forget his father's love for him. He wants to forget how he treated him, because he feels wrong to forget all the things he did to him. "My children left on a cold night, my husband said it's how things go, like rabbits blinded by the light, kids want a better place to grow." He's saying that his father doesn't want him to be alone anymore, he just wants to be with his children, and be happy, and not be alone. He's also saying that when he's young, he will never be able to see the sun, because it's the only place he'll ever be happy. He just wants his children to grow up, and live a happy, happy life.
Ground Truth: Where this song is placed on the album, and the album in general, I think is about a sort of soldier of fortune who in his youth falls in love with a girl, and before going off promises her great wealth when he returns. This song takes place years later, after he has been gone for a long time, and she has found someone else, had children of her own, and they have left her. This is her reflecting back on her life, and that soldier she fell in love with, and had attached feelings of excitement and adventure to. She is unaware that he never stopped loving her, and wanted to return, but, according to the final song, presumably died far away on another shore. And yes, it is put before Iron to serve as a stark contrast of two worlds, the lover's, and the soldier's.
Lyrics: Cold, cold water surrounds me now; ; And all I've got is your hand; Lord, can you hear me now?; Lord, can you hear me now?; Lord, can you hear me now?; Or am I lost?; ; Love one's daughter; Allow me that; And I can't let go of your hand; Lord, can you hear me now?; Lord, can you hear me now?; Lord, can you hear me now?; Or am I lost?; ; Cold, cold water surrounds me now; And all I've got is your hand; Lord, can you hear me now?; Lord, can you hear me now?; Lord, can you hear me now?; Or am I lost?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a girl, but he can't let go of her. He's trying to get her back, but she won't let him. He wants her to be with him, even though he knows she doesn't want to. "Cold cold water surrounds me nowAnd all I've got is your handLord, can you hear me now? Or am I lost? Love one's daughterAllow me thatAnd I can'tLet go of your hand"He's asking God if he can hear him now, or if he's lost. "Love one's DaughterAllow me ThatAnd I Can't Let Go Of Your Hand"He wants to see her again, and he wants to know if she still loves him, or is lost.
Ground Truth: so.. i was just iistening to 'cold water' (LOVE IT by the way) and at the end that haunting chanting comes back, but it's backwards, and i was wondering if anyone knew what they are saying. are they just chanting"don't you know i love youand i always havehallelujahwill you come to me"backwards? ephneron July 18, 2005   
Lyrics: And I'd give up forever to touch you; 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow; You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be; And I don't want to go home right now; ; 'Cause all I can taste is this moment; And all I can breathe is your life; So when sooner or later it's over; I just don't want to miss you tonight; ; And I don't want the world to see me; 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand; When everything's made to be broken; I just want you to know who I am; ; And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming; Or the moment of truth in your lies; When everything feels like the movies; Yeah, you bleed just to know, you're alive; ; And I don't want the world to see me; 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand; When everything's made to be broken; I just want you to know who I am; ; I want you guys to take this one home, alright?; ; And I don't want the world to see me; 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand; When everything's made to be broken; I just want you to know who I am; ; And I don't want the world to see me; 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand; When everything's made to be broken; I just want you to know who I am; I just want you to know who I am; I just want you to know who I am; I just want you to know who I am; Yeah...; You guys are the best; This is the best 4th of July ever, ever; Give yourselves some love!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but he doesn't want her to know that he loves her. "And I'd give up forever to touch you'Cause I know that you feel me somehowYou're the closest to heaven that I'll ever beAnd I don't want to go home right now'Cause all I can taste is this momentAll I can breathe is your lifeSo sooner or later it's overI just don't wanna miss you tonight"He knows that he'll be with her forever, and that he will always love her no matter what happens. He knows that she will always be there for him no matter how hard he tries to hide it. He wants her to be able to show that she's alive, even though she doesn't know it. "I just want you to know who I amAnd you can't fight the tears that ain't comingOr the moment of truth in your liesWhen everything feels like the moviesYeah, you bleed just to know you're alive"He wants to show her that he is alive, and he just wants the world to see that he's alive. "When everything's made to be broken, I just want You to Know Who I AmI want you guys to take this one home alrightYou guys are the bestThis is the best 4th of July ever, everGive yourselves some love! Give yourselves some Love! Give yourself some love!"
Ground Truth: iris in greek means rainbow. reread the lyrics, and you'll understand. yes some of it may be for a heartache, but notice how it has so much more meaning than just a person. think rainbow. ((RED))on May 23, 2007   
Lyrics: Keep the noise low; She doesn't wanna blow it; Shaking head to toe; While your left hand does the show me around; Quickens your heartbeat; It beats me straight into the ground; You don't recover from a night like this; A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless; A hand moves in the dark to a zipper; Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets; Barely whisper, this is so messed up; Upon arrival the guests had all stared; Dripping wet and clearly depressed; He'd headed straight for the stairs; No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch; Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships; He keeps his hands low; He doesn't wanna blow it; He's wet from head to toe and; His eyes give her the up and the down; His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up; But the body on the bed beckons forward; And he starts growing up; The fever, the focus; The reasons that I had to believe; You weren't too hard to sell; ; Die young and save yourself; The tickle, the taste of; It used to be the reason I breathed; But now it's choking me up; Die young and save yourself; She hits the lights; This doesn't seem quite fair; Despite everything he learned from his friends; He doesn't feel so prepared; She's breathing quiet and smooth; He's gasping for air; This is the first and last time, he says; She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his; He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides; He's holding back from telling her; Exactly what it really feels like; He is the lamb, she is the slaughter; She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her; Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect; He whispers that he loves her; But she's probably only looking for; So much more than he could ever give; A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship; He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides; He waits for it to end; And for the aching in his guts to subside; The fever, the focus; The reasons that I had to believe; You weren't too hard to sell; Die young and save yourself; The tickle, the taste of; It used to be the reason I breathed; But now it's choking me up; Die young and save yourself; Up the stairs: the station where; The act becomes the art of growing up; The fever, the focus.; The reasons that I had to believe; You weren't too hard to sell; Die young and save yourself; The tickle, the taste of; It used to be the reason I breathed; But now it's choking me up, die young and save yourself
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a boy who is in love with a girl, but he can't seem to get her out of his mind. He can't stop thinking about her, and he has to deal with the fact that he doesn't know how to make her feel. He wants to be with her, but she doesn't want him to. He doesn't think he's ready for a relationship, but it's too late for him. He's waiting for her to come back to him and tell him how much she means to him, and that he's the only one who can give her a meaningful relationship. It's just a story about a guy who's going through a rough patch in his life, and when he says "She's probably only looking for so much more than he could ever give, a life free of lies and a meaningful relationships", he's talking about how he's just waiting for it to end, and how it's choking him up.
Ground Truth: The title of the song is actually a line from Rushmore. Brandtson has a song with the same title, and several others titled from quotes from Wes Anderson movies. I think this is Brand New's only Wes reference, but they do quote Home Alone 2 on the same album. TheWorldIsOnFireon June 16, 2004

Lyrics: Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze; Fickle freshman, probably thinks she's cooler than you; A hay ride at five, everybody's comin' around; So go press you skirt, word is there's a new girl in town.; ; I call shotgun, you can play your R 'n B tunes; The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon; The land of the creeds, freshened up from baby faced shame; Put your eyes on me, and I know a place that we can get away.; ; Just say I want you, just exactly like I used to; 'Cause baby this is only bringin' me down.; ; Home-boy's so proud, he finally got the video proof; The night vision shows, she was only duckin' the truth; It's heavy I know, the black guy with the gift down below; A choke and a gag, she spit up 'n came back for more.; ; She said I want you, just exactly like I used to; And baby this is only bringin' me down.; She said I want you; ; I want you, just exactly like I used to; And baby this is only bringin' me down.; I said I want you, just exactly like I used to; And baby this is only bringin' me down.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl who is a slut, but he doesn't want to be with her because she's a slut. "Get back on track pick me up some bottles of boozeFickle freshman, probably thinks she's cooler than youA hay ride at fiveEverybody's comin' aroundSo go press you skirt, word is there's a new girl in townI call shotgun, you can play your R 'n B tunesThe fellowship time, it always comes a little too soonThe land of the creeds, freshened up from baby faced shamePut your eyes on me and I know a place that we can get awayJust say I want youJust exactly like I used toAnd baby this is only bringing me downHome-boy's so proud, he finally got the video proofThe night vision showsShe was only duckin' the truthIt's heavy I knowThe black guy with the gift down belowA choke and a gagShe spit up 'n came back for moreShe said I wantYouJust exactlyLike I Used ToAnd Baby This is only bringin' me downI said I wanted you just exactly likeI used toand baby this's only bringing him downI want you, just exactly Like I Used to"I think that means that he wants her, but she doesn't feel the same way, so he's telling her that she's better off without him. "Home-boys so proudHe finally got a video proof"He's proud that he got the proof of her being a slut and he's proud of it. "Night vision shows, she was only ducking the truth"She's proud and proud of the fact that he's been with her for so long, and he is proud of her. "It'sHeavy I know, the black guyWith the giftDown below"He is proud that she was "ducking" the truth. He's proud to be proud of him, but it's hard for him to tell her that he loves her. He knows that he'll never be able to get over her, and that she'll be happy if he's with her.
Ground Truth: this song is obviously about a girl who is new in a small town. gets introduced to everyone at the bonfire and gets labeled a slut just because she gave a black guy a blow job. and he video taped it. he shows it around, everyone makes fun of her, humiliate her, say she's gross and a slut but he still wants her, just exactly like he used. his feelings for her haven't changed. he doesn't care what people think.He wishes he could pursue her but the girl doesn't trust anyone and isolates herself. but he likes her- a lot, it's that all of this that has happened has been bringing him down. but if she puts her eyes on him he knows a place they can get away, from everyone. if only she would. he wants her exactly like he used but everything has been bringing him down because he's in love with her. I can't believe the lyrics up there were wrong at first, you don't have to read the lyrics to understand what they're saying, just clean out yor eyes...the words aare soo not hard to make out.

Lyrics: Daddy please hear this song that I sing; In your heart there's a spark that just screams; For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep; And love all you have left like your boy used to be; Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet; ; Blister please with those wings in your spine; Love to be with a brother of mine; How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth; In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight; Sounding only at night as you sleep; ; And in my dreams you're alive and you're cryin'; As your mouth moves in mine soft and sweet; Rings of flowers round your eyes and I love you; For the rest of your life in your; ; Brother see we are one in the same; And you left with your head filled with flames; And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth; Push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see; Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek; ; And when we break we'll wait for our miracle; God is a place where some holy spectacle lies; When we break we'll wait for our miracle; God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life; ; Two headed boy, she is all you could need; She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires; And retire to sheets safe and clean; But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who loves a girl, but he doesn't love her back. He wants to be with her, but she doesn't want him to. "In your heart there's a spark that just screamsFor a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleepAnd love all you have left like your boy used to beLong ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet"He wants her to know that he loves her. "Blister please with those wings in your spine"He doesn't know how to find her tongue in his teethIn a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tightSounding only at nightAs you sleep"He loves her so much that he can't even sleep. "And in my dreams you're alive and you're cryingAs your mouth moves in mine soft and sweetRings of flowers round your eyes and I love you for the rest of your life in yourBrother see we are one in the sameAnd you left with your head filled with flamesAnd you watched as your brains fell out through your teethPush the pieces in placeMake your smile sweet to seeDon't you take this awayI'm still wanting my face on your cheek"He's still in love with her and he's still trying to convince her that she can't be with him, and that he will always love her for who she really is, even if she is gone. He's still wanting her face on his cheek"And when we break we'll wait for our miracleGod is a place where some holy spectacle lies"He still wants her, even though he knows that she's gone, and he still loves her for the part of her life in his heart. "Brother seeWe are oneIn the same"He knows that he's going to have to face the fact that he is going to die, so he's just waiting for her to come back to him, because he knows she'll always be there for him. "Two headed boyShe is all you could needShe will feed you tomatoes and radio wiresAnd retire to sheets safe and cleanBut don't hate her when she gets up to leave"He is telling her to stay with him and not hate him for what he did to her.
Ground Truth: The family from the 1940s is Anne Frank's family. Mangum mentions the name 'Anna' in the song, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea also. Her father survived, but the rest of the family didn't, which explains the first stanza. p_money4on May 20, 2008   
Lyrics: It's easier to run; Replacing this pain with something numb.; It's so much easier to go; Than face all this pain here all alone.; ; Something has been taken from deep inside of me,; A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see.; Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away,; Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played.; ; If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would; Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would; If I could stand up and take the blame, I would; If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would; If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would; Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would; If I could stand up and take the blame, I would,; I would take all my shame to the grave.; ; It's easier to run; Replacing this pain with something numb.; It's so much easier to go; Than face all this pain here all alone.; ; Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past,; Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have.; Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back,; And never moving forward so there'd never be a past.; ; If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would; Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would; If I could stand up and take the blame, I would; If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would; If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would; Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would; If I could stand up and take the blame, I would,; I would take all my shame to the grave.; ; Just washing it aside,; All of the helplessness inside,; Pretending I don't feel misplaced,; Is so much simpler than change.; ; It's easier to run; Replacing this pain with something numb.; It's so much easier to go; Than face all this pain here all alone.; ; It's easier to run!; If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would; Retrace every wrong move that I made; It's easier to go!; If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would; Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would; If I could stand up and take the blame, I would,; I would take all my shame to the grave.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about someone who has been through a lot of pain in their life and is trying to get away from it. He wants to take back the pain, but he knows that he has to make it right and move on. "It's easier to runReplacing this pain with something numbIt's so much easier to goThan face all this pain here all aloneSomething has been taken from deep inside of meA secret I've kept locked awayNo one can ever seeWounds so deep they never showThey never go awayLike moving pictures in my headFor years and years they've playedIf I could changeI would take back all the painI wouldRetrace every wrong move that I madeI wouldIf I can stand up and take the blameI wouldSometimes I think of letting goAnd never looking backAnd never moving forwardSo there'd never be a past"He wants to move on from the pain he has caused but he doesn't want to. "Just washing it asideAll of the helplessness insidePretending I don't feel misplacedIs so much simpler than change"He's trying to convince himself that he is doing the right thing and that he won't have to go through it again, but it's so hard to do it again. He's saying that he wants to forget the pain and move forward. "Sometimes I remember the darkness of my pastBringing back these memories I wish I didn't have"This is him trying to forget what he's done and moving on. He wishes he could just forget all the things he did wrong and forget the bad things that happened to him. He knows he can't do it and he's telling himself that it's better to go back to the way things were when he was young and he knows it's not going to happen again, and he wants it to be easier to live without the pain. He also wants to get over the pain of his past and forget about the things that hurt him and that's why he's trying so hard.
Ground Truth: It is obvious that this song is about abuse, more importantly, sexual abuse. It's about his emotional scars and how he's so ashamed that something like that happened to him. "It's easier to runReplacing this pain with something numbIt's so much easier to goThan face all this pain here all alone"He's hurting so much and feels so alone, and just wants to get away from the person who caused him pain"Something has been takenFrom deep inside of meA secret I've kept locked awayNo one can ever see"The something in reference was his innocence/purity. After the incident, it changed him completely. "Wounds so deep they never show,They never go awayLike moving pictures in my headFor years and years they've played"He's talking about his emotional scars. From the outside, no one can see them, but that doesn't mean they're not there. In fact, they're so deep that he can't heal them, and he can't get the events out of his head. "If I could change I wouldTake back the pain I wouldRetrace every wrong move that I made I wouldIf I could"It's like he blames himself for what what happened. Anf if he could go back in time and avoid the situation, he'd be fine. "Stand up and take the blame I wouldIf I could take all the shame to the grave I would"Essentially he feels like he is to blame. I've heard that a lot of people blame themselves for things like that. "Sometimes I rememberThe darkness of my pastBringing back these memoriesI wish I didn't haveSometimes I think of letting goAnd never looking backAnd never moving forward soThere would never be a past"Seems to me like he's contemplating suicide. He wants to forget what happened and not look back, but the only way to truly do this would be for him to kill himself. "Just washing it asideAll of the helplessness insidePretending I don't feel misplacedIs so much simpler than change"He feels different from everyone around him and like he doesn't belong. He feels like there's nothing he can do about it, and he's just going to feel this way for the rest of his life. This song is so sad and v
Lyrics: I don't care if Monday's blue; Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too; Thursday I don't care about you; It's Friday, I'm in love; Monday you can fall apart; Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart; Oh, Thursday doesn't even start; It's Friday, I'm in love; ; Saturday wait; And Sunday always comes too late; But Friday never hesitate; ; I don't care if Monday's black; Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack; Thursday never looking back; It's Friday, I'm in love; ; Monday you can hold your head; Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed; Or Thursday watch the walls instead; It's Friday, I'm in love; ; Saturday wait; And Sunday always comes too late; But Friday never hesitate; ; Dressed up to the eyes; It's a wonderful surprise; To see your shoes and your spirits rise; Throwing out your frown; And just smiling at the sound; And as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and 'round; Always take a big bite; It's such a gorgeous sight; To see you eat in the middle of the night; You can never get enough; Enough of this stuff; It's Friday, I'm in love; ; I don't care if Monday's blue; Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too; Thursday I don't care about you; It's Friday, I'm in love; Monday you can fall apart; Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart; Thursday doesn't even start; It's Friday, I'm in love
Sample outputs: I think this song is about being in love with someone you love, but you don't really care about them. It's a wonderful surprise to see your shoes and your spirits riseThrowing out your frownAnd just smiling at the soundAnd as sleek as a shriek spinning 'round and roundAlways take a big biteIt's such a gorgeous sightTo see you eat in the middle of the nightYou can never get enoughEnough of this stuffIt's Friday, I'm in loveI don't care if Monday's blueTuesday, Wednesday, heart attackThursday never looking backI think it's about the fact that you're in love, and you can't stop thinking about it, because you're so obsessed with it, and it's all you can think about, and that's what it's like to be in love.
Ground Truth: this song reminds me of a really happy time in my life. it will always be a happy song for me probably. unless it becomes sad, in which case....it will no longer be happy. and that would be bad....and sad. rainydayboyon April 17, 2003   
Lyrics: Look at the stars; Look how they shine for you; And everything you do; Yeah, they were all yellow; ; I came along; I wrote a song for you; And all the things you do; And it was called Yellow; ; So, then, I took my turn; Oh, what a thing to've done; And it was all yellow; ; Your skin; Oh, yeah, your skin and bones; Turn in to something beautiful; You know; You know I love you so; You know I love you so; ; I swam across; I jumped across for you; Oh, what a thing to do; 'Cause you were all yellow; ; I drew a line; I drew a line for you; Oh, what a thing to do; And it was all yellow; ; Your skin; Oh, yeah, your skin and bones; Turn in to something beautiful; You know; For you, I'd bleed myself dry; For you, I'd bleed myself dry; ; It's true; Look how they shine for you; Look how they shine for you; Look how they shine for; Look how they shine for you; Look how they shine for you; ; Look how they shine; Look at the stars; Look how they shine for you; And all the things that you do
Sample outputs: I think it's about someone who is in love with someone, but she doesn't want to be with them. She wants to do everything for them, but the person doesn't love her back. So she does what she can to get them to love her, but it's not what she wants. It's a beautiful song.

Lyrics: She's got her halo and wings; hidden under his eyes; but she's an angel for sure; she just can't stop telling lies; But it's too late for his love; already caught in a trap; his angel's kiss was a joke; and she is not coming back; Because heaven sends and heaven takes; crashing cars in his brain; keep him tied up to a dream; and only she can set him free; and then he says to me; Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now; kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now; Yeah she's got a criminal mind; he's got a reason to pray; his life is under the gun; he's got to hold every day; Now he just wants to wake up; yeah, just to prove it's a dream; 'cause she's an angel for sure; but that remains to be seen; Because heaven sends and heaven takes; crashing cars in his brain; keep him tied up to a dream; and only she can set him free; and then he says to me; Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now; kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now; Stupid on the streets of london; james dean in the rain; without her it's not the same; the same, the same, but it's alright; Because heaven sends and heaven takes; crashing cars in his brain; keep him tied up to a dream; and only she can set him free; and then he says to me; Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now; kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now; again and again
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl who is a criminal mind. He's got a reason to pray, his life is under the gun, he's got to hold every day. But he wants to wake up, just to prove it's a dream, cause she's an angel for sure, but that remains to be seen. I think it's about how he's been in love for a long time, but he can't get her out of his mind, and he's trying to convince himself that it's just a dream.
Ground Truth: I just find it coincidental that so many Killers songs reference James Dean, Greta Garbo, Marlon Brando etc. famous alleged or confirmed bisexuals. Almost every celebrity he mentions in a song. The song itself? Well I always thought it was about the death of a girlfriend, or she might be in a coma, and he crashed into her... but it could also have something to do with the Jenny Was a Friend of Mine story. Maybe he didn't kill her and just blames himself anyway. Zytheon December 18, 2005   
Lyrics: No one knows what it's like; To be the bad man; To be the sad man; Behind blue eyes; ; And no one knows what it's like; To be hated; To be fated; To telling only lies; ; But my dreams they aren't this empty; As my conscience seems to be; I have hours, only lonely; My love is vengeance; That's never free; ; No one knows what it's like; To feel these feelings; Like I do; And I blame you; ; No one bites back as hard; On their anger; None of my pain and woe; Can show through; ; But my dreams they aren't this empty; As my conscience seems to be; I have hours, only lonely; My love is vengeance; That's never free; ; Discover L I M P say it; Discover L I M P say it; Discover L I M P say it; Discover L I M P say it; Discover; ; No one knows what it's like; To be mistreated; To be defeated; Behind blue eyes; ; And no one knows how to say; That they're sorry; And don't worry; I'm not telling lies; ; But my dreams they aren't this empty; As my conscience seems to be; I have hours, only lonely; My love is vengeance; That's never free; ; No one knows what it's like; To be the bad man; To be the sad man; Behind blue eyes
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is depressed and doesn't know what it's like to be a bad man. He's trying to get out of the depression but he can't, so he's telling himself that he's not a bad guy. It's a sad song, but it's a good song.
Ground Truth: well i see it as most people with blue eyes are seen as sweet and innocent ,or at least potrayed that way and its about being an angry sad person but you keep it all inside and all together so someone wont see your raw anger maybe its about a family man and he loves his kids but is frustrated with his wife or ex but wont let it show through so he bites back on his anger so the kids wont seethe other way i see it is "blue eyes: sometimes means sad eyes. so hes saying you dont know what its like for me your not in my situation . i always thought it was: none of my pain wont cant show through"happyloveon January 18, 2013   
Lyrics: You could've been all I wanted; But you weren't honest; Now get in the ground; You choked off the sorriest of favors; But if you really loved me; You would've endured my will; ; Well, you're just as I presumed; You're a whore in sheep's clothing; Fucking up all I do; Yeah and if, oh, here we've stopped; Then never again will you see this in your life; ; And on to the glory at my right hand; Here laid to rest is our love ever low; With truth on the shores of confession; You seem to take premise to all of these so...; ; You stormed off to scar the Armada; Like Jesus played leader; I'll drill through your hands; The stone for the curse you have blamed me; ; With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep; But if you could just write me out; To never this wonder; Happy will I become; ; Be true that this is no option; So, with I condemn you; Demon, pray demon out; ; And on to the glory at my right hand; Here laid to rest is our love ever low; With truth on the shores of comfession; You seem to take premise to all of these so...; ; One last kiss for you; One more wish to you; Please make up your mind girl; I'd do anything for you; One last kiss for you; One more wish to you; Please make up your mind girl; Before I hope you die
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, and he loves her so much that he wants to kill her, but she doesn't love him back. He's telling her that he'll do anything for her, even if it's just to get her out of his life. I think it's about a girl who's in a relationship with a guy, but he doesn't want to be with her, so he's saying that he's going to do anything to make her forget about him.
Ground Truth: Edit the lyrics (I'm reading these from the cd slip)You choked off the surest of favorsBut if you really loved meYou would've endured my worldWell your just as i presumedA whore in sheep's clothingF*ing up all i doAnd if it's here we stopThen never againWill you see this in your life? ... Here laid to rest is our love ever longed? With truth on the shores of compassionYou seem to make premise to all of these songs...As jesus played later... The stone for the curse you have blamed meMy love and devotion I'll die as you sleepIf you could just write me outTo neverless wonder.. happy will i becomeBe true that this is no option,So with sin i condemn youDEMON PLAY, DEMON OUT! Hope that helps some peepsmr_e_87on September 26, 2005   
Lyrics: Girl, been a long time that we've been apart; Much too long for a man who needs love; I missed you since I've been away; Babe, wasn't easy to leave you alone; Getting harder each time that I go; If I had the choice I would stay; There's no one like you; I can't wait for the nights with you; I imagine the things we'd do; I just wanna be loved by you; No one like you; I can't wait for the nights with you; I imagine the things we'd do; I just wanna be loved by you; Girl, there are really no words strong enough; To describe all my longing for love; I don't want my feelings restrained; Ooh, Babe, I just need you like never before; Just imagine you'd come through this door; You'd take all my sorrow away; There's no one like you; I can't wait for the nights with you; I imagine the things we'd do; I just wanna be loved by you; No one like you; I can't wait for the nights with you; I imagine the things we'd do; I just wanna be loved by you; ; No one like you; I can't wait for the nights with you; I imagine the things we'd do; I just wanna be loved by you; No one like you; I can't wait for the nights with you; I imagine the things we'd do; I just wanna be loved by you
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who loves a girl so much that she wants to be with him. He's saying he can't wait for the night with her, and he doesn't want to be apart from her.
Ground Truth: definitely an intense love song.when it comes on the radio the hair on my arms stand up and the volume goes way up. hard to say if it`s my favorite scorpions song as every time i hear another one of their hits i think that one is and so on . might just be that scorpions are the greatest rock n` roll band that ever was.

Lyrics: It started out as a feeling; Which then grew into a hope; Which then turned into a quiet thought; Which then turned into a quiet word; ; And then that word grew louder and louder; 'Til it was a battle cry; I'll come back; When you call me; No need to say goodbye; ; Just because everything's changing; Doesn't mean it's never been this way before; All you can do is try to know who your friends are; As you head off to the war; ; Pick a star on the dark horizon; And follow the light; You'll come back; When it's over; No need to say goodbye; You'll come back; When it's over; No need to say goodbye; ; Now we're back to the beginning; It's just a feeling and no one knows yet; But just because they can't feel it too; Doesn't mean that you have to forget; ; Let your memories grow stronger and stronger; 'Til they're before your eyes; You'll come back; When they call you; No need to say goodbye; You'll come back; When they call you; No need to say goodbye
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is going to war. He is saying that he will come back when it's all over. "Just because everything's changing doesn't mean it's never been this way before." I think that he is talking about how he doesn't want to say goodbye to his loved one. "All you can do is try to know who your friends areAs you head off to the war." He wants to know if his loved ones are safe. "Pick a star on the dark horizon and follow the light. You'll come backWhen it's over." He's saying that no matter how hard he tries to get away from the war, he will always be there for him. "Now we're back to the beginningIt's just a feeling and no one knows yetBut just because they can't feel it tooDoesn't mean that you have to forget"He's saying he's going to do whatever he can to make sure he's okay. "Let your memories grow stronger and stronger 'til they're before your eyes." This is my favorite line. I love this song.
Ground Truth: I kind of think this song has less to do with an actual war, but with the development of relationships. It starts off with a feeling, then it's like this cute little thing. The beginning of a relationship is way different then later on, everything's different and yet still the same. And in most cases, it's still good. I think the "no need to say goodbye" is saying that even if your not with the other person at the moment, you'll always be there for them. At least, that's how i see this song as. colourguardgirlx3on March 22, 2009

Lyrics: Close the door and take the stairs.; Up or down? Ups and downs,; well don't pretend you've never been there.; You kiss me like an overdramatic actor; who's starving for work,; with one last shot to make it happen.; You've won the role, you've played your part,; you've been cordially invited. But I'm not impressed,; and I'm definitely not excited,; because the film runs a shallow budget,; and the writer's subject script isn't any deeper.; So dive right in...; Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,; hey you, who are you kidding?; I'm not like them. I won't buy in.; Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,; hey you, who are you kidding?; Don't quit 'til 47,; then we'll turn it up, and we'll play a little faster.; ; Take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of it.; You never did.; Take back everything you said, you never meant a word of it.; You never did. She said.; ; 'Alright, Alright, slow down! Oh no, oh no, we won't,; 'cause I regret everything I said to ever make her feel; like she was something special,; or that she ever really mattered.; Did she ever really matter?; ; Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,; hey you, who are you kidding?; I'm not like them. I won't buy in; Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,; just don't count on this summer.; Don't quit 'til 47. Then we'll turn it up and; we'll play a little faster.; ; Take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of; it. You never did.; Take back everything you said, you never meant a word of it.; You never did.; ; I'm not saying that; I'm not breaking some hearts tonight, girl.; I'm not saying that; I'm not breaking some hearts tonight, girl; Alright, alright, slow down...; ; Take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of it.; You never did.; Take back everything you said, you never meant a word of it.; You never did
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, and he is saying that he is not like them, and that he doesn't want to be like them. but he knows that he has to let go of her, because he's not going to give up on her. and he's trying to convince himself that he will get over her, even though he knows she isnt going to get over him. i think the song is a little bit about how he regrets everything he did to make her feel like she was something special, or that she ever really mattered, but he regrets it because he regrets the things he did, and regrets that he did. i also think the line "take back everything you ever said, you never meant a word of it" could mean that he regrets his actions, but that he can't change the fact that he didn't really mean anything to her, so he's telling himself to slow down, and stop thinking about her. i love this song. it's one of my favorite songs on the album. i can relate to it so much, but it's just so hard to explain. i don't know what to think about it, but i love the way he sings it, and i love how he says "Alright, alright, slow down! Oh no, oh no, we won't, cause I regret everything I said to ever make you feel like, she was somethin special,or that she never really mattered." i think it's a great song, and one of the best songs i've heard in a long time. and i'm glad i got the chance to see it live. it makes me cry everytime i listen to it. i wish i had the time to see them live. i hope they come back to me soon. i'm not sure if i'll ever see them in concert again, but this is what i got from it. xoxoxoxon April 30, 2007   
Ground Truth: I think that this person is trying to be persuaded into the life as a star, sicne they are in a rising band and stuff, but they are refusing since they aren't like that. I love this song no matter what it means though. an0nmouson March 31, 2006   
Lyrics: Oh, yeah; ; Side by side; I'll be yours forever; Yes I will; Rain or shine; Any kind of weather; Any kind; ; There isn't anything; I wouldn't do for you; Let's take what's getting old; And make it new; ; Oh, eye to eye; It's a blinding confrontation; You and I; We're a deadly combination; ; So don't start mixing; Truth with jealousy; The road we're on is clear; As far as I can see; ; Pamela; Don't break this heart of mine; Just remember it may not heal this time; ; Pamela; There is no second chance; For the one who leaves it all behind; Yeah, yeah; I love you, little girl; ; Black and white; Always go together; Day and night; You're the precious jewel I treasure; ; Wanting every part of you; Is not a crime; Could it be that you're the one; Who's wrong this time; ; Pamela; Don't break this heart of mine; Just remember it may not heal this time; ; Pamela; There is no second second chance; For the one who leaves it all behind; Leave all; ; Oh, Pamela, oh; Thousands of miles away; But always in my heart; ; Pamela; So don't break this heart of mine; Just remember it may not heal this time; ; Pamela; There is no second chance; For the one who leaves it all behind; ; Pamela; Don't break this heart of mine; Just remember it may not heal this time; ; Pamela; There is no second chance; For the one who leaves it all behind; Leave all behind
Sample outputs: I love this song. It's about a guy who is in love with a girl, and he's trying to convince himself that he'll always be there for her, but he can't. He's saying that he won't give up on her, and that he's going to do anything for her. I think this song is about a relationship that's falling apart, and the guy is telling the girl that he will always be with her, even if it's just for a short time, because he knows that she's not the one who's wrong this time.
Ground Truth: Oh man! Did this song ever fit my life when it came out. I was going crazy over an unrequited love interest who happened to be named Pamela. We were only separated by three years in age, but were looking for different things, each with good reasons. Getting to the song, I think this is pretty much straightforward; he wants the relationship to be more than she does, feels much more than she does, what I DON'T get is how he seems to be implying that she's jealous...if anything, I think he is (rightfully) jealous of her. She seems to not want anything serious between them, he's saying "wanting EVERY PART OF YOU is not a crime." Well, that's just MHO of what this song means, of course it was greatly influenced by what was happening to me at the time. Mary's Prayer by Danny Wilson was out at roughly the same time, and that song can bring back even more emotion than this one (especially when watching the video), but I digress.
Lyrics: Back to the streets where we began; Feeling as good as lovers can, you know; Well, now we're feeling so good; ; Pickin' up things we shouldn't read; It looks like the end of history as we know; It's just the end of the world; ; Back to the street where we began; Feeling as good as love, you could, you can; ; Into a place, where thoughts can bloom; Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon; And we know that it could be; And we know that it should; And you know that you feel it too; 'Cause it's nine in the afternoon; ; Your eyes are the size of the moon; You could 'cause you can so you do; We're feeling so good; Just the way that we do; When it's nine in the afternoon; ; Your eyes are the size of the moon; You could 'cause you can so you do; We're feeling so good; ; Back to the street; Down to our feet; Losing the feeling of feeling unique; Do you know what I mean?; ; Back to the place, hey; Where we used to say; Man it feels good to feel this way; Now I know what I mean; ; Back to the street, back to the place; Back to the room where it all began; Back to the street, back to the place; Back to the room where it all began; 'Cause it's nine in the afternoon; ; Your eyes are the size of the moon; You could 'cause you can so you do; We're feeling so good; Just the way that we do; When it's nine in the afternoon
Sample outputs: I think this song is about drugs. "Back to the streets where we beganFeeling as good as lovers can, you knowWell now we're feeling so goodPicking up things we shouldn't readIt looks like the end of history as we knowIt's just the End of the World"He's saying that he's feeling good because he's high and he can't help but feel good. "You could 'cause you can so you do"He wants to go back to the place where he used to say, "Man it feels good to feel this wayNow I know what I mean"He knows that it's not going to happen, but he's trying to convince himself that it won't. "Your eyes are the size of the moonYou could cause you canSo you do." He's saying he doesn't care what happens to him, he's just feeling good. That's what I think.
Ground Truth: I think i might be the only freak who thinks this song isnt about drugs or sexits about being happyall throught the song he keeps saying how happy hes feeling"Back to the streetDown to our feetLosing the feeling of feeling uniqueDo you know what I mean?" is saying how hes losing all his happinessabbyanayaon February 29, 2008   
Lyrics: Right now; ; I am an antichrist; And I am an anarchist; Don't know what I want; But I know how to get it; I wanna destroy passerby; 'Cause I wanna be Anarchy; ; No dog's body; ; Anarchy from the U.K.; It's coming sometime and maybe; I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line; Your future dream is a shopping scheme; 'Cause I; I wanna be anarchy; ; In this city; ; How many ways to get what you want; I use the best; I use the rest; I use the N.M.E.; I use anarchy; 'Cause I wanna be anarchy; ; It's the only way to be; ; Is this the M.P.L.A.?; Or is this the U.D.A.?; Or is this the I.R.A.?; I thought it was the U.K.; Or just another country; Another council tenacy; ; I wanna be anarchy; And I wanna be anarchy; ; Oh what a name!; ; And I wanna be an anarchist; I get pissed destroy!
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how people are always trying to get what they want out of life, but they can't get it because they don't know how to get it. "I want to destroy passerby'Cause I wanna be Anarchy,No dog's body"I think that's what the song is talking about. "Is this the M.P.L.A. Or is this the U.D.A.? I thought it was the UKOr just another countryAnother council tenacy"I don't think it's about the police. I think that it's more about how the police want to control people, and how they're trying to control them. "And I wanna destroy passersby'cause I want to be AnarchyIt's the only way to be"The police are trying to stop people from doing whatever they want, and the people who want to do it are the ones who don't want to get involved in it. The police want people to do what they're told to do, and if you don't like them, then you can't do anything about it.
Ground Truth: i wish peeps wud stop having a go at the anachists. I dont think that it would work, but people can beleive it if they want. Sure the sex pistols were qwite poppy, and are nothing compared to iggy, ramones or clash, but they were still really good, and inspired countless other bands. Punk is not about style, of talent, its about expressing what you think, and not caring what other people think. voodoo_gimpon November 10, 2004   
Lyrics: Train set and match spied under the blind; Shiny and contoured the railway winds; And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed; The hiss of the train at the railway head; ; Always the summers are slipping away; ; 60 ton angel falls to the earth; A pile of old metal, radiant blur; Scars in the country, summer and her; ; Always the summers are slipping away; Find me a way for making it stay; ; When I hear the engine pass, I'm kissing you wide; The hissing subsides, I'm in luck; When the evening reaches here you're tying me up; I'm dying of love, it's okay; ; When I hear the engine pass, I'm kissing you wide; Hissing subsides, I'm in luck; When the evening reaches here you're tying me up; I'm dying of love, it's okay; Always the summers are slipping away; Find me a way for making it stay; Always the summers are slipping away; Always the summers are slipping away
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, and he's trying to make it work, but she's just holding him back. "When I hear the engine passI'm kissing you wideThe hissing subsidesI'm in luckWhen the evening reaches hereYou're tying me upI'm dying of loveIt's okay"I think it's about a girl who's been in a relationship for a long time, and the guy is trying to convince himself that it's going to be okay, but it's not. I think that's what the song means to me.
Ground Truth: For some reason, the '60 ton angel, falls to the earth, a pile of old metal, a radiant blur' line always makes me picture the Angel of the North statue (in Gateshead, UK) for some reason, even though I am sure it is just referring to a train. Jake1985on November 19, 2007

Lyrics: Come on, skinny love, just last the year; Pour a little salt, we were never here; My my my, my my my, my my; Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer; ; I tell my love to wreck it all; Cut out all the ropes and let me fall; My my my, my my my, my my; Right in this moment, this order's tall; ; And I told you to be patient; And I told you to be fine; And I told you to be balanced; And I told you to be kind; ; And in the morning I'll be with you; But it will be a different kind; And I'm holding all the tickets; And you'll be owning all the fines; ; Come on, skinny love, what happened here?; Suckle on the hope in light brassieres; My my my, my my my, my my; Sullen load is full, so slow on the split; ; And I told you to be patient; And I told you to be fine; And I told you to be balanced; And I told you to be kind; ; And now all your love is wasted; And then who the hell was I?; And I'm breaking at the breaches; And at the end of all your lines; ; Who will love you?; Who will fight?; Who will fall far behind?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a relationship that has fallen apart. It's about a guy who is trying to make the relationship work, but it's not working. He's trying to convince himself that it's going to work out, but he can't. "Come on skinny loveJust last the yearPour a little salt we were never here"He's saying that he doesn't want it to end, and he wants it to last forever. "Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneerI tell my love to wreck it allCut out all the ropes and let me fallMy my my my, my,my, myMy, myRight in this momentThis order's tall"He wants the relationship to end. "And I told you to be patient and I told your to be fineAnd I tell you to balancedAnd I'll be kindAnd in the morningI'll be with youBut it will be a different kindAnd I'm holding all the ticketsAnd you'll be owning all the fines"He is telling himself that he'll be there for him no matter what. "Suckle on the hope in light brassieres"He doesn't know what to do with himself, he just wants to be with her. "The sullen load is full, so slow on the split"He tells himself that everything will be alright, but that he's just going to have to wait for her to come around to him. "In the morning I’m with you,But it’ll be different kind"He'll be holding all of the tickets, and she'll be the one who will pay the fines. "Now all your love is wastedAnd then who the hell was I?" He's asking himself who will love him, who will fight? Who will fall far behind? "Who will love you,Who will fightWho will fallfar behind?
Ground Truth: for me, this is a song about a daddy who's found out that his daughter has an eating disorder, and is absolutely crushed and disappointed. the way he sings "and i told you to be..." sounds like he's scolding her, she should have known better that to hurt them both. which leads me to think that he's not such a good father, maybe even the cause of the eating disorder. blaaah, this is just my interpretation. :3emmadoesthetimewarpon October 01, 2009   
Lyrics: In a church, by the face; He talks about the people goin' under; ; Only child know; ; A man decides after seventy years; That what he goes there for is to unlock the door; While those around him criticize and sleep; ; And through a fractal on a breaking wall; I see you my friend and touch your face again; Miracles will happen as we trip; ; But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy; No, we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy; ; Yellow people walkin' through my head; One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one; And yet together they were friends at school; (Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it, no, no); ; If all were there when we first took the pill; Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe; Miracles will happen as we speak; ; But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy; No, we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy; No no, never survive, unless we get a little bit; ; A man decides to go along after seventy years; ; Oh darlin', in a sky full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?; ; In a world full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy, crazy?; In a heaven of people there's only some want to fly, ain't that crazy?; Oh babe (oh darlin'), in a world full of people; There's only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?; (Isn't that crazy?, isn't that crazy?, isn't that crazy?); ; Ohh, but we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy; No, we're never gonna to survive unless we are a little crazy; But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy; No, we're never gonna to survive unless we are a little crazy; No, no, never survive unless we get a little bit; ; And then you see things; The size of which you've never known before; They'll break it; Someday; Only child know; Them things; The size; Of which you've never known before; Someday...
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how the world is full of people who are crazy and want to fly, but they're never going to survive unless they get a little crazy. I think this is a song about how people are always going to be crazy because they just want to be happy and they don't want to grow up. It's also about how we are never gonna survive unless we have a little bit of fun and we're never gonna be able to do anything about it. The part about Yellow people walking through my head is about the people who don't know what they're doing and how they are always there for them. The yellow people are the people that have a gun to shoot the other one and yet together they were friends at school. The Yellow people are people who want to do whatever they can to get out of the world but they are afraid that if they get caught up in the world they will end up doing something that they can never do. They are the ones who are afraid to do what they want because they are scared that they will get caught. The last verse is saying that if all were there when we first took the pill, then maybe then maybeThen maybe,Then maybeMiracles will happen as we speakBut we’re never going surviveUnless we get a bit crazyNo, we're not gonna surviveunless we are a littlecrazyNo, never survive Unless we geta little bitAnd then you see thingsThe size of which you’ve never known beforeThey’ll break itSomedayOnly child know themThingsThe sizeOf which you've never know beforeSomededayOnly child knows themThingsThat sizeOfWhich you'veNever known beforeSomewhereIn a world full ofPeopleThere’s only someWant to flyIsn’t that crazy?
Ground Truth: it mentions church and miracles happening specifically with the guy opening the church (which is his friend). but they both took their own 'pill'. which is one of them went one way and the other another. but together they both see the same things. so they reunite and decide they both need to be a little opposite and crazy in order to survive. the chuch guy has to believe what the drug guy sees, and the drug guy has to believe the church guy. most importantly the message is that everything is a little crazy, but it's ok.nullnoron December 22, 2011   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau; Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know; Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand; To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands; ; Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop; And an illustrated book about birds; See a lot up there but don't be scared; Who needs action when you got words; ; You've finished with the mop then you can stop; And look at what you've done; The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen; And the work it was fun; ; Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop; And an illustrated book about birds; See a lot up there but don't be scared; Who needs action when you got words; ; Many hands began to scan around for the next plateau; Some said it was in Greenland and some say Mexico; Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood; But those were all just guesses; Wouldn't help you if they could
Sample outputs: I think this song is about how we are all just trying to fit in, but we all have our own expectations and expectations of what we should be doing. "The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen, and the work it was fun"This is a great song. I think it's about how the world is so full of things that we have no idea what we are doing. It's a song that can be interpreted in many different ways, but it can also be applied to many different situations. "Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateauSome belong to strangers and some to folks you knowHoly ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sandTo beautify the foothills and shake the many hands"This seems to be about how there are so many people out there that are so busy trying to figure out what they are doing that they can't really do anything about it. "Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mopAnd an illustrated book about birdsSee a lot up there but don't be scaredWho needs action when you got wordsYou've finished with the mopThen you can stopAnd look at what you've doneThe plateau’s clean,No dirt to seeAnd the work its fun"I think that this is saying that they have reached a certain point in their lives where they are happy. They are happy with what they have done, and they want to move on. "Some said it was in Greenland and some say MexicoOthers decided it was nowhere except for where they stoodBut those were all just guessesWouldn't help you if they could"This refers to how they were looking for the next plateau but they didn't know what it was. They were just looking for something to do, something to make them happy. "There's a lot of people up there that don't know where they stand, but those were just guesses, wouldn't helpYou if they can"This could be referring to the fact that they think they know what they want, but they don't want to know because they're not sure what it is. "Nights began to scan around forThe next plateau"The plateau is a place that they're looking for. They're trying to find something that they want but can't find it. They don't really know what to do. The next plateau is the plateau where they're going to be
Ground Truth: You guys make things so difficult and complex. I think the song is about finding something that makes you happy. I think the plateau symbolizes happiness. And when you get bored of it, you go and look for a new one. high5inmferon June 29, 2006   
Lyrics: The most remarkable thing about coming home to you; Is the feeling of being in motion again,; ; It's the most extraordinary thing in the world.; I have two big hands; And a heart pumping blood; And a 1967 Colt .45; With a busted safety catch.; ; The world shines; As I cross the Macon county line,; Going to Georgia.; ; The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you; And that you are standing in the doorway; ; And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand; I am frozen with joy right where I stand.; The world glows its slide underneath your hair.; 40 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere.; ; Going to Georgia; ; The world shines; As I cross the Macon county line,; Going to Georgia
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a young man who is going to Georgia to live his life to the fullest. The world is shining as he cross the Macon county line, going toGeorgia. The most remarkable thing about coming home to youIs the feeling of being in motion againIt’s the most extraordinary thing in the worldI have two big handsAnd a heart pumping bloodAnd a 1967 Colt.45With a busted safety catchThe world shines as I cross theMacon County lineGoing to GeorgiaThe world glows as you ease the gun from my handI am frozen with joy right where I standThe World glows its slide underneath your hair40 miles from Atlanta, this is nowhereGoing toGeorgiaThe World shinesAs I cross a Macon County LineGoing to GAThe most remarkable part about you standing in the doorway is that it’S youAnd that you are standing in a doorwayAnd you smile as youEase the gunFrom my hand, I am frozenWith joy rightWhere I standI am freezing with joyRight where I stoodThe world shows its slide beneath your hair 40 miles from GeorgiaThis is nowhereGo to GeorgiaI think that this is about the young man's love for his wife, and how he feels about her. He wants to go to Georgia because he feels like the world is falling apart. He feels like he is in love with her, and he doesn't want to leave her, but he's happy because he knows she loves him. He doesn't know what to do. He just wants to be with her and he wants to move on. He loves her so much that he is willing to do anything to make her happy. He's "frozen with joy" right where he stands. He can't stop thinking about her, even though he knows it's wrong.
Ground Truth: "The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you and that you are standing in the doorway and you smile as you ease the gun from my hand, I am frozen with joy right where I stand." is one of my favorite lines in a song ever, though it's "And I'm" not "I am" but who really cares? NOT ME! SasquatchAttackon May 22, 2004   
Lyrics: Come on. Ooh, yeah.; Never be the same again.; I call you up whenever things go wrong.; You're always there.

(Never be the same again); It's just the beginning it's not the end. (We've only just begun); Things will never be the same again.; It's not a secret anymore.; Now we've opened up the door. (Opened up the door); Starting tonight and from now on.; We'll never, never be the same again.; Never be the same again.; Nite and day.; Black beach sand to red clay.; The US to UK, NYC to LA.; From sidewalks to highways.; See it'll never be the same again.; What I'm sayin'; My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged.; But sometimes it seems completely forbidden.; To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden.; Where there's no competition.; And you render my condition.; Though improbable it's not impossible.; For a love that could be unstoppable.; But wait.; A fine line's between fate and destiny.; Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?; When you tell me the stories of your quest for me.; Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly.; And as our energies mix and begin to multiply.; Everyday situations, they start to simplify.; So things will never be the same between you and I.; We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified.; I thought that we would just be friends.; Things will never be the same again.; It's just the beginning it's not the end.; Things will never be the same again.; It's not a secret anymore.; Now we've opened up the door.; Starting tonight and from now on.; We'll never, never be the same again.; (Come on, come on); Things will never be the same again.; (You are the one); Never be the same again.; It's not a secret anymore.; We'll never be the same again.; It's not a secret anymore.; We'll never be the same again.; Never be the same again.; Never be the same again.; Never be the same again.; Never be the same again.; (Melanie Chisholm/Rhett Lawrence/Paul F Cruz/Lisa Lopes/Lorenzo Martin)
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been in love with a girl for a long time, and she's always there for him when he needs her, and he's trying to get over her, but he can't because he's afraid that she'll leave him.

It's not that secret anymore. "What I'm sayin'My mind frames never changed until you come rearranged"He's saying that he's not sure if he's going to be together forever, or if he'll just stay with her forever, but that he'll always be there for her no matter what.
Ground Truth: omg princess i went through almost all the same stuff u did. but instead of getting closer in the end, it all crashed and burned and now we barely speak. i still like him but its just gotten too weird and i feel as if i have to start from the very bottom of the barrel :(:( but anyway, this song is awesome i love it! mel c has such a great voice! sleepy1015on July 26, 2002

Lyrics: Don't want to be an American idiot; Don't want a nation under the new media; And can you hear the sound of hysteria?; The subliminal mind fuck America; ; Welcome to a new kind of tension; All across the alien nation; Where everything isn't meant to be okay; ; Television dreams of tomorrow; We're not the ones who're meant to follow; For that's enough to argue; ; Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America; I'm not a part of a redneck agenda; Now, everybody into the propaganda; And sing along to the age of paranoia; ; Welcome to a new kind of tension; All across the alien nation; Where everything isn't meant to be okay; ; Television dreams of tomorrow; We're not the ones who're meant to follow; For that's enough to argue; ; Don't want to be an American idiot; One nation controlled by the media; Information age of hysteria; It's calling out to idiot America; ; Welcome to a new kind of tension; All across the alien nation; Where everything isn't meant to be okay; ; Television dreams of tomorrow; We're not the ones who're meant to follow; For that's enough to argue
Sample outputs: i love this song. i think it's about how we've been controlled by the media, and how we can't trust the media. i agree with everyone else that the song is about the war in Iraq, but i think its about how the media is controlling us, and we're not meant to follow them, because we don't want to be part of it. i don't think the video is supposed to be a political song, but it's a good one. i love the fact that the video has nothing to do with the war, but the song has a very political feel to it, and i'm pretty sure that's why it's called "American Idiot" because it's so political. i'm not saying it's anti-american, i'm just saying that it's not anti-American, and that it doesn't have to be. it's just a great song. and i think the lyrics are good too, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a good message. and if you don't like the song, don't bother commenting on it, because you're stupid. and don't post on a song, because that's not what you're supposed to do. and that's just my opinion. and by the way, if you're going to post on something, you should post a comment on it. and please don't tell me that i'm wrong, i just want to say that you're not the only one who thinks this is a good song, or that it isn't. if you want to comment on this song, then why don't you comment on what you think it is about, or what it means to you? and why not comment on the song? if u don't agree with me, then don't comment on my opinion, because if you do, then you're a fucking moron. i mean, that's what i'm trying to say, but you can't just go on and on about how stupid you are. and then you can go on about what you like, and what you dislike about the song. you can say whatever you want about it, but if you like it, then let me know. and for those of you who don't know, go to the website and comment. and you'll see what I'm saying, but don't bash me for being a moron, because I'm not trying to offend you. anyway, i love green day, and I don't care what people think about them,
Ground Truth: Not unitlateral? do you have a pulse? That's the biggest issue here, of course we acted unilaterally. We contributed 250,000 troops. Compare that to our second greatest supporter Britain who contrbuted 45,000 troops then comes Australia with 2000 troops, and 200 polish troops. No, there was not over 100 countries in the coalition which wouldnt make sense anyway since there are only 193 countries in the world in the first place. The truth is that 48 countries wanted Saddam removed. If you look at the list, only about 20 of those 48 countries gave some sort of significant political support. The rest of the world condemned the war. How is it that we go about enforcing UN resolutions by violating the essence of the UN charter. The UN inspectors said that there were no weapons of mass destruction and it seems that they are correct. Did we need to spend billions of dollars and thousands of lives to make sure of what they told us? How can you extreme right wingers say you were enforcing the word of the UN when most of you want to pull out of the institution? About soldiers doing what is necessary to survive, that is the reason these crimes were commited. These troops lives are put in danger for no reason so they have to do their best to survive. So they resort to measures such as shooting an unarmed dying man in a mosque in Iraq or massacring hundreds of women and children in a Vietnamese village. Arrogant perspectives that we can continue this as long as we want is what will ultimately lead to the fall of our country. Buddy, the humiliation of the prisoners goes against the geneva convention. Yes I agree that american soldiers are heroes, but acts of torture and ill treatment cannot be tolerated. Are you saying that because the terrorists beheaded some prisoners that it is okay for us to sexually abuse our prisoners?We have higher standards than that. The abuse started before the beheadings anyway. Terrorism should not be the center of our foreign policy. blindon March 04, 2005   
Lyrics: Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street; So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit; Because I feel it all fading and paling and I'm begging; To drag you down with me, to kick the last nail in; ; Yeah, I like you in that, like I like you to scream; But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible; For quite what goes in or to care what comes out; So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout; ; And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over; If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder; So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet; And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street; ; So pull on your hair, pull on your pout; Cut the conversation, just open your mouth; Pull on your face, pull on your feet; And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street; ; Down on Fascination Street; Down on Fascination Street; Down on Fascination Street; On Fascination Street
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to admit it, and he's trying to get her to open her mouth to him, but he can't. "So just pull on your hair and get out for a bit"He wants her to get out of the relationship, but it's too late. "Cause I feel it all fading and paling and I'm beggingTo drag you down with meTo kick the last nail in"He's begging for her to let him go, because he's tired of it. "Yeah, I like you in that, like I want you to screamBut if you open your mouth then I can't be responsibleFor quite what goes in or to care what comes out"He doesn't care if she's in love or not, but if she opens her mouth, he won't let her go. "And let's move to the beat like we know that it's overIf you slip going under, slip over my shoulder"He just wants to be with her, but can't because he doesn't know what to do with her. So he's begging to drag her down with him, to kick the nail in, to make her feel better about herself. He's saying that he's not responsible for anything, but that if she lets him go he'll be responsible for her actions. "If you fall going under slip over his shoulder"I don't think this is about sex. I think it's about a person who's in a relationship with a guy, and they're trying to make it work, but they can't do it, because they don't want it to ruin the relationship. "Just pull on her hair, pull on you poutCut the conversation, just open you mouthPull on her facePull on your feetAnd let’s hit opening time down on Fascination Street"I think that's what the song means to me. I'm not sure what it means, but I'm guessing it's a metaphor for a relationship that's not working out. "Oh, it's opening time, down on fascination streetSo let's cut the conversation and get into a bitBecause I feel that it all's fading and PalingAnd I'm begin' to drag youDown with me to kick a nail in." He's begging her to give him a chance, to let go of the past and move on. He wants to
Ground Truth: This is my absolutely most favorite song of all time. I love it. Everything about it is perfect. The guitar, the drums, the singing, and everything. If I am pissed or upset I just listen to this song and it makes my life complete. I love it. DZestmenon May 04, 2006   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: She's taking her time making up the reasons; To justify all the hurt inside; Guess she knows from the smiles; And the look in their eyes; Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one; ; They're saying; Mama never loved her much; And daddy never keeps in touch; That's why she shies away from human affection; But somewhere in a private place; She packs her bags for outer space; And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come; (and she'll say to him); ; She's saying; I would fly to the moon and back; If you'll be, if you'll be my baby; Got a ticket for a world where we belong; So would you be my baby?; ; Ooh-ooh; She can't remember a time when she felt needed; If love was red then she was color-blind; All her friends they've been tried for treason; And crimes that were never defined; ; She's saying; Love is like a barren place; And reaching out for human faith; Is like a journey I just don't have a map for; So baby gonna take a dive and; push the shift to overdrive; Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars; (What a pleasant dream); ; Just saying; I would fly to the moon and back; If you'll be, if you'll be my baby; Got a ticket for a world where we belong; So would you be my baby?; ; Mama never loved her much; And daddy never keeps in touch; That's why she shies away from human affection; But somewhere in a private place; She packs her bags for outer space; And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come; (And she'll say to him); She's saying; I would fly to the moon and back; If you'll be, if you'll be my baby; Got a ticket for a world where we belong; So would you be my baby?; yeah
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy, but she can't be with him because she doesn't want to be with someone else. She's waiting for someone to come to her rescue, but doesn't have the courage to do it because she's afraid of being hurt. She doesn't know what to do with herself, so she's just waiting for the right guy to come and save her.
Ground Truth: I think this is an amazing song, and I love it. I agree with what's already been said, the song is about a girl who's become cold on the outside because she's been hurt many times but on the inside she secretly wishes to be loved. I'm kinda confused about these two lines though;All her friends they've been tried for treasonAnd crimes that were never definedI'm not sure but does it mean that she drifts away from her friends as well, so sure they will end up hurting her too? And she finds excuses to not be close to them? Let me know how you interpret this part. spongebob_1771on April 14, 2005   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: So while I'm turning in my sheets; And once again, I cannot sleep; Walk out the door and up the street; Look at the stars beneath my feet; Remember rights that I did wrong; So here I go; ; Hello, hello; There is no place I cannot go; My mind is muddy but; My heart is heavy, does it show?; I lose the track that loses me; So here I go; ; Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu; ; And so I sent some men to fight; And one came back at dead of night; Said he'd seen my enemy; Said he looked just like me; So I set out to cut myself; And here I go; ; Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu; ; I'm not calling for a second chance; I'm screaming at the top of my voice; Give me reason, but don't give me choice; 'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again; ; Ahuuuuu; ; And maybe someday we will meet; And maybe talk and not just speak; Don't buy the promises 'cause; There are no promises I keep; And my reflection troubles me; So here I go; ; Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu; ; I'm not calling for a second chance; I'm screaming at the top of my voice; Give me reason, but don't give me choice; 'Cause I'll just make the same mistake; ; I'm not calling for a second chance; I'm screaming at the top of my voice; Give me reason, but don't give me choice; 'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again; ; Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu Ahuuuuu; ; (Ahuuuuu) Saw the world turning in my sheets; (Ahuuuuu) And once again, I cannot sleep; (Ahuuuuu) Walk out the door and up the street; (Ahuuuuu) Look at the stars; (Ahuuuuu) Look at the stars fall down; (Ahuuuuu) And I wonder where; (Ahuuuuu) Did I go wrong
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a woman who has been cheated on by a man, but she can't sleep because she doesn't want to be alone. She doesn't know where she went wrong, and she wonders where she made the mistake. She's not calling for a second chance, because she knows she's going to regret it. She realizes that she's messed up, and that she wants to change, but it's not going to happen.
Ground Truth: It's about a man who's got it all wrong in the past, messed up everything time after time despite trying so hard. He ends up walking away or otherwise breaking the relationship. He realizes he's alone because he is the problem himself and he wants to change but needs someone to save him. He's desperate to find someone who he loves so much he simply has no choice anymore. He needs the one to give him a reason to stay. Not so that he can stay but must stay because of such strong feeling. phnix76on October 17, 2014   
Lyrics: Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something; Lightweights steppin' aside when we come in; Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping; People on the street then panic and start running; Words on loose leaf sheet, complete coming; I jump in my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumping; Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in; Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming; Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping; Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping; Risk something, take back what's yours; Say something that you know they might attack you for; 'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before; Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for; Like this war's really just a different brand of war; Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor; Like they understand you, in the back of their jet; When you can't put gas in your tank, these fuckers; Are laughing their way to the bank, and cashing their check; Asking you to have compassion and have some respect; For a leader so nervous in an obvious way; Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay; And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day; In the living room, laughing like, "What did he say?"; ; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; ; In my living room watching it, but I am not laughing; 'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen; The war is cold, the bold men take action; Have to react to get blown into fractions; At ten years old, there's something to see; Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep; Taken and bound and found later under a tree; I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'; Do you see the soldiers that are out today?; They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away; It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray; But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday; There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads; Inside your market, your shops, and your clothes; My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know; But enough pride inside not to let that show; My brother had a book he would hold with pride; A little red cover with a broken spine on the back; He hand-wrote a quote inside; "When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"; Meanwhile, the leader just talks away; Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay; ; The rest of the world watching at the end of the day; Both scared and angry, like "What did he say?"; ; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; Amen; ; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you; With hands held high into a sky so blue; The ocean opens up to swallow you
Sample outputs: I think this song is about war. I think it's about how the government is telling us that we should fight for what we believe in, and that we have no choice but to fight for it.

Ground Truth: Ok so I think that its obvious that this song is Anti-war. Not necessarily anti every war, just this one and this song illustrates the bad things about war. I do like the way this song sounds and even though the subject is not the happiest it manages to have an uplifting feel. On another note I guess reading the comments on this song has opened my mind to a couple of things. Maybe its because I am English and don't understand the American way. But most of us are sat here in england thinking how can anyone support bush so I am surprised to find so many people defending him. It's not a bad thing just interestingEvilsheepon June 07, 2007

Lyrics: We're on our own, cousin; All alone, cousin; Let's think of a game to play; Now the grown-ups have all gone away; You won't be much fun; Being blind, deaf and dumb; But I've no one to play with today; Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?; To find me it would take you a week; But tied to that chair; You won't go anywhere; There's a lot I can do with a freak; ; How would you feel if I; Turned on the bath; Ducked your head under; And started to laugh?; What would you do if I shut you outside; To stand in the rain; And catch cold so you died?; ; I'm the school bully; The classroom cheat; The nastiest play friend; You ever could meet; I'll stick pins in your fingers; And tread on your feet; ; We're on our own, cousin; All alone, cousin; Let's think of a game to play; Now the grown-ups have all gone away; You won't be much fun; Being blind, deaf and dumb; But I've no one to play with today; Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?; To find me it would take you a week; But tied to that chair; You won't go anywhere; There's a lot I can do with a freak; ; Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm; Would change your expression; To one of alarm; I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair; Or give you a push; At the top of the stairs; ; I'm the school bully; The classroom cheat; The nastiest play friend; You ever could meet; I'll put glass in your dinner; And spikes in your seat
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a kid who is bullied by his cousin. He has no one to play with because he doesn't want to hurt his cousin and he wants to kill himself. I think the line "I'll put glass in your dinner and spikes in your seat" is a reference to the fact that his cousin has a gun and he can't kill himself, so he kills himself by shooting himself in the head. The line "Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm would change your expression to one of alarm" is saying that he will kill himself if he kills his cousin, and that if he did kill himself he would be the only one who can do it with him.
Ground Truth: i think the cousin is the uncle's son i'm not vey sure htough. the part in the movie for this is so horrible haha (not the music but the things billy idol does to roger)good song though. i love the line "maybe a cigarette burn in your arm would change your expression to one of alarm"cosmicjiveon March 07, 2006   
Lyrics: Why don't you ask the kids at Tienanmen square; Was fashion the reason why they were there; They disguise it, hypnotize it; Television made you buy it; ; I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my; ; She's scared that I will take her away from there; Her dreams that her country left with no one there; Mezmerized the simple minded; Propaganda leaves us blinded; ; I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl; I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl; ; I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl; I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my... girl
Sample outputs: I think this song is about the war in iraq, and how they are trying to make it look like it's happening. I think it's about the media and how people are blind to what is going on in the world. "She's scared that I will take her away from thereHer dreams that her country left with no one thereMezmerized the simple mindedpropaganda leaves us blindedI'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl"I think that's saying that the media is trying to tell us that it's okay to do what we want to do and that we shouldn't worry about it. It's also saying that we should be aware of what's going on around us and not worry about what's happening to us. I don't know, I just think that that's what it means to me.
Ground Truth: I think the line "Was fashion the reason why they were there?" is a stab at the modern day kids. Maybe they're telling us that the people at Tiananmen Square were there not "just because", but because they really wanted freedom. Whereas that's not the case with most kids now. They're all doing it to fit in. I don't really know how to explain this =\Crujebsulon October 15, 2006   
Lyrics: The stars lean down to kiss you; And I lie awake and miss you; Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere; 'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly; But I'll miss your arms around me; I'd send a postcard to you, dear; 'Cause I wish you were here; ; I'll watch the night turn light blue; But it's not the same without you; Because it takes two to whisper quietly; The silence isn't so bad; 'Till I look at my hands and feel sad; 'Cause the spaces between my fingers; Are right where yours fit perfectly; ; I'll find repose in new ways; Though I haven't slept in two days; 'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone; But drenched in vanilla twilight; I'll sit on the front porch all night; Waist deep in thought because when; I think of you I don't feel so alone; ; I don't feel so alone; I don't feel so alone; ; As many times as I blink; I'll think of you tonight; (Tonight, tonight, tonight...); ; I'll think of you tonight; ; When violet eyes get brighter; And heavy wings grow lighter; I'll taste the sky and feel alive again; And I'll forget the world that I knew; But I swear I won't forget you; Oh if my voice could reach back through the past; I'd whisper in your ear:; "Oh darling, I wish you were here"
Sample outputs: This song reminds me of my best friend, who passed away a few weeks ago. I think of him every time I hear it. I miss him so much, and I wish I could be with him all the time, but I can't. It's such a beautiful song, and one of the best songs I've ever heard. I love the way she sings it.
Ground Truth: This is really about the fact that the singer is dating a girl, Ann Munson, who lives in California and attends my school, Azusa Pacific University. They grew up together in Minnesota, and he still lives there currently, so they are doing the whole long distance relationship thing. This is why he misses her so much! coloradochik24on November 03, 2009   
Lyrics: It's Monday morning; And I would kill for a chance to drive; Get so far away from here with you my dear; That I'll never leave your side; Nobody knows the troubles I've seen; In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see; ; Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me; To be a monument for the rest of them; Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me; To be a monument for the rest of them; ; We're getting older; I've started to fear for my life; Is this the way that it should be?; This whole thing's riding on me; ; It's been a long road so far; With nowhere to turn; There's no looking back from here; No more dwelling on my fears; ; Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me; To be a monument for the rest of them; Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me; To be a monument for the rest of them; ; Twenty bucks says you'll remember me; When you see me on your TV screen; It may be the first time; But it won't be the last time; ; Twenty bucks says you'll remember me; When you see me on your TV screen; It may be the first time; But it won't be the last time; ; Twenty bucks says you'll remember me; When you see me on your TV screen; It may be the first time; But it won't be the last time; ; And I'll scream; So loud that everyone in this place; Will hear every word I say; Cause this is my time, this is my time to shine; Let nothing stand in our way; ; And I'll scream; So loud that everyone in this place; Will hear every word I say; Cause this is my time, this is my time to shine; Let nothing stand in our way; ; Twenty bucks says you'll remember me; When you see me on your TV screen; It may be the first time; But it won't be the last time
Sample outputs: this is a really good song. i think it's about a guy who is in a relationship with a girl, and he wants to be with her, but he doesn't want to because he's afraid of the consequences. he wants her to remember him, and that's why he says "I'll scream so loud that everyone in this place will hear every word I say" because he knows it's going to happen. but he can't help but think about her, because he has to be there for her. and he knows that it won't be the last time, so he's saying "this is my time to shine, let nothing stand in our way" because it's his time to show her how much he cares about her. he's telling her that he'll be there when she sees him on her TV screen, and it may be the first time, but it wont be this last time. and i'll scream, so loud, that everyone around him will hear each word he says, cause this is my timeto shine, and let not stand in their way. he knows she will remember him when he sees her on her tv screen, but she won't hear him. he also knows that if she ever sees him again, she'll remember him. that's what i think of when i listen to this song. it's a really great song, and i can't wait for the new album to come out. i love it. i want to listen to it over and over again. it really makes me feel like i'm in a better place. i know it's not the best place to be, but i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks this song is about a relationship, and this is a great song for that. it makes me think of a lot of people who are in relationships, but they don't really have feelings for each other. i don't know if this is true or not, but this is what i got out of it. and it's just my interpretation of the song. I'm not sure if it's right or wrong, but that's just what i thought of it when i first heard it.
Ground Truth: this is a love story song but its mostly about being somebody "twenty bucks says you will remember me when yousee me on your tv screen" like when people doubted him but hes gonna prove them wrong, hence the name "monument"and its his time to shine its what he worked for his success overcoming everything =]jumbugjvon February 04, 2009   
Lyrics: I've got another confession to make; I'm your fool; Everyone's got their chains to break; Holdin' you; ; Were you born to resist, or be abused?; ; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; ; Or are you gone and onto someone new?; ; I needed somewhere to hang my head; Without your noose; You gave me something that I didn't have; But had no use; I was too weak to give in; Too strong to lose; ; My heart is under arrest again; But I'll break loose; My head is giving me life or death; But I can't choose; I swear I'll never give in; I refuse; ; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; ; Has someone taken your faith?; It's real, the pain you feel; You trust, you must confess; ; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; ; Has someone taken your faith?; It's real, the pain you feel; The life, the love; You'd die to heal; The hope that starts; The broken hearts; You trust, you must confess; ; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; ; I've got another confession my friend; I'm no fool; I'm getting tired of starting again; Somewhere new; ; Were you born to resist, or be abused?; I swear I'll never give in, I refuse; ; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?; Has someone taken your faith?; It's real, the pain you feel; You trust, you must confess; ; Is someone getting the best; The best, the best, the best of you?
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who is in love with a girl who is getting the best of him. He doesn't want to be with her anymore, but he's tired of being with her. He wants to start over with a new girl, but she's getting the better of him and he doesn't know what to do about it. "I needed somewhere to hang my headWithout your nooseYou gave me something that I didn't haveBut had no useI was too weak to give inToo strong to loseMy heart is under arrest againBut I'll break looseMy head is giving me life or deathBut I can't chooseI swear I'll never give inI refuse"He wants to get back with her but he can't because he's too weak. "Has someone taken your faith? It's real, the pain you feelThe life, the loveYou'd die to healThe hope that startsThe broken heartsYou trust, you must confess"He's asking her if she's still with him, or if she doesn't love him anymore. He's saying that she's going to do anything to get him back. I don't know if this is right or wrong, but that's what I think.
Ground Truth: This song freakin' ROCKS! Everyone's gonna have a different interpretation of it but essentially I reckon it's gotta be plain about someone getting the best of you. Taking what you got. Song ROcks! fallenbrokenon June 25, 2005
