Lyrics: Hang on, just hang on for a minute; I've got something to say; I'm not asking you to move on or forget it; But these are better days; To be wrong all along and admit it is not amazing grace; But to be loved like a song you remember; Even when you've changed; ; Tell me did I go on a tangent?; Did I lie through my teeth?; Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?; Did I bring shame on my family?; Did it show when I was weak?; Whatever you see, that wasn't me; That wasn't me, that wasn't me; ; When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust; And you will hide from every god like he never turns his back on us; And you will fall all the way to the bottom and fall on your own knife; And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life; ; Tell me did I go on a tangent?; Did I lie through my teeth?; Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?; Did I bring shame on my family?; Did it show when I was weak?; Whatever you see, that wasn't me; That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me; ; But I want you to know that you'll never be alone; I wanna believe do I make myself a blessing to everyone I meet; When you fall I will catch you on your feet; Do I spend time with my family?; Did it show when I was weak?; When that's what you see, that will be me; That will be me; That will be me; That will be me
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who broke up with his girlfriend, and he's still trying to get over it. It's a beautiful song, but it's not perfect. I think it's about how he realizes that he'll never be able to make it work, and how he wants to be with her, even if it doesn't take his life, but he still wants her back, even though he knows that he will never be the same. He wants to make sure that he doesn't let his love ruin his life. "When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trustAnd you will hide from every god like he never turns his back on usand you will fall all the way to the bottom and fall on your own knifeAnd you'll learn who you areEven if it doesnt take your life"This song reminds me of a guy in a relationship who has lost his love for a long time. He's trying to make himself a blessing to everyone he meets. "Tell me did I go on a tangent?Did I lie through my teeth? Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?" "Did I bring shame on my family?" "Whatever you see, that wasn't meThat wasn’t me" I love this song so much. It’s so beautiful. I love the way he sings it so much, it makes me want to sing it every time I listen to it. “When you’re lost, to be wrong all along and admit it is not amazing graceBut to be loved like a song you rememberEven when you've changed” I think this song is talking about how you can be with someone who has changed. It makes me think of how he’ll always be loved and loved, even when he has changed and he knows he can never be alone.
Ground Truth: After listening to this song for the first time it was very clear to me the song is about addiction. My brother suffered from an addiction for majority of his life and only now has been 11 months sober. This song sounds like the words he would write. Beautiful lyrics, as usual.
Lyrics: It's time the tale were told; Of how you took a child; And you made him old; It's time the tale were told; Of how you took a child; And you made him old; You made him old; Reel around the fountain; Slap me on the patio; I'll take it now; ; Oh...; Fifteen minutes with you; Well, I wouldn't say no; Oh, people said that you were virtually dead; And they were so wrong; Fifteen minutes with you; Oh, well, I wouldn't say no; Oh, people said that you were easily led; And they were half-right; Oh, they ... oh, they were half-right, oh; ; It's time the tale were told; Of how you took a child; And you made him old; It's time that the tale were told; Of how you took a child; And you made him old; You made him old; Oh, reel around the fountain; Slap me on the patio; I'll take it now; Ah ... oh ...; ; Fifteen minutes with you; Oh, I wouldn't say no; Oh, people see no worth in you; Oh, but I do.; Fifteen minutes with you; Oh, I wouldn't say no; Oh, people see no worth in you; I do.; Oh, I... oh, I do; Oh...; ; I dreamt about you last night; And I fell out of bed twice; You can pin and mount me like a butterfly; But "take me to the haven of your bed"; Was something that you never said; Two lumps, please; You're the bee's knees; But so am I; Oh, meet me at the fountain; Shove me on the patio; I'll take it slowly; Oh...; ; Fifteen minutes with you; Oh, I wouldn't say no; Oh, people see no worth in you; Oh, but I do.; Fifteen minutes with you; Oh, no, I wouldn't say no; Oh, people see no worth in you; I do.; Oh, I... I do; Oh, I do; Oh, I do; Oh, I do
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who has a child and he's old. He has a kid and he wants to be with his girl but he can't be with her because he's so old. It's about how he's used to being with her and how he doesn't want to be around her anymore. He wants her back, but he knows that he'll never be able to do it. He knows that if he's not with her, he will never be with him. He doesn't know how to love her anymore, and he just wants to spend time with her. He's still in love with her even though she's gone. He can't say no to her, because he knows she'll never love him again. He loves her so much and wants to make her happy.
Ground Truth: I think it's about losing your innocence (and liking it) but having the other person just see you as a sex object...while you see them as something more special. Even though you know they only want to sleep with you...you love them so much that you just cannot say no to another lust-filled 15mins. Personally, I think that child molestation stuff is ridiculous nonsense...enolfon March 10, 2006   
Lyrics: I have such envy; For the stranger lying next to me; Who awakes in the night; And slips out into the pre-dawn light; ; With no words, a clean escape; No promises or messes made; And chalks it all up; To mistake, mistake, mistake; ; And there are no tears; Just pity and fear; And a vast ravine; Right in between; ; A storm at sea; The bow cracked and I was capsizing; And I sunk below; Where I swore I would never go; ; If you can't stand in place; You can't tell who's walking away; From who remains; Who stays, who stays, who stays; ; And there are no tears; Just pity and fear; And a vast ravine; Right in between; ; 'Cause there are no tears; Just pity and fear; And I recall; The push more than the fall; The push more than the fall
Sample outputs: i think this song is about a man who is in love with a girl, but he doesn't know how to get over it. he wants to be with her but he can't because he knows that he will never be able to do it. so he tries to make things better for her, but she doesn't want him to know that he's there for her. he loves her so much but he wants her to stay. and he knows he'll never get over her. i think this is about him trying to get away from her, and he's trying to make it better, but it doesn't work. he has no words, a clean escape, no promises or messes made, and chalks it all up to mistake, mistake, mistakes. and there are no tears, just pity and fear and a vast ravine right in between. he's so proud of her and she's the one who is there for him. but he still has to try to make her happy, and that's what he's doing. it's the hardest thing he's ever had to do, and it makes him realize that he can never go back to her, even though he knows she'll never be there again. i agree with the rest of the song, i think it's about how he's ready to be back with her and how he feels when he realizes she's gone. it reminds him of the time he was with her, when he was in the hospital and he thought he was going to die, but then he realized that he couldn't. he was afraid of losing her, so he says he'll stay with her. and that he has to stay in his place. he says "I can't stand in place, you can't tell who's walking away from who remains, who stays, and who stays who stays." and he says that he'll be back, but that he won't go back. "I'm not going to go back, I'm going to stay, and I'll never go." it's just a beautiful song, and is one of the most beautiful songs of all time. this song reminds me of me when I was in high school, and how I used to cry whenever I heard it. i love this song. it makes me cry every time i listen to it. it just makes me think of her, it reminds me so much of me. and i love her.
Ground Truth: You know what? I just figured out the abrupt ending. "I recall the push more than the fall." The singer falls and ponders about why the other person pushed him over the edge. And all of a sudden, splat. Fucking brilliant. crimsondawnon May 10, 2008   
Lyrics: One of these days the ground will drop out from beneath your feet; One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat; One of these days the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing; One of these days their bombs will drop and silence everything; ; But it's alright; Yeah it's alright; ; I said it's alright; Easy for you to say; Your heart has never been broken; Your pride has never been stolen; ; Not yet not yet; One of these days; I bet your heart'll be broken; I bet your pride'll be stolen; I'll bet I'll bet I'll bet I'll bet; One of these days; ; One of these days; One of these days your eyes will close and pain will disappear; ; One of these days you will forget to hope and learn to fear; But it's alright; Yeah it's alright; ; I said it's alright; Easy for you to say; Your heart has never been broken; Your pride has never been stolen; ; Not yet not yet; One of these days; I bet your heart'll be broken; I bet your pride'll be stolen; I'll bet I'll bet I'll bet I'll bet; One of these days; ; One of these days; But it's alright; Yeah it's alright; ; I said it's alright; Yeah it's alright; Don't say it's alright; ; Don't say it's alright; Don't say it's alright; ; One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat; But it's alright; Easy for you to say; Your heart has never been broken; Your pride has never been stolen; Not yet not yet; One of these days; I bet your heart will be broken; I bet your pride will be stolen; I'll bet I'll bet I'll bet I'll bet; One of these days; One of these days; One of these days
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been in a relationship for a long time and he is trying to figure out how to fix it. "One of these days the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing" is a reference to the end of his relationship with his girlfriend, and how he is looking forward to the day when he will finally be able to be with her again. "I said it's alright, easy for you to say your heart has never been broken, your pride has been stolen" is how he relates to his girlfriend. "Not yet not yet" is the way he says he is going to break up with her, but he doesn't want to hurt her. "It's alright. I said it’s alright. Easy for me to say, your heart hasn’t been broken" is what he means to me.
Ground Truth: This song is basically saying fuck optimism. Talk to me when you've been through what I've been through and felt what I've felt. Then I'll believe you when you say "it'll be alright"In other words, don't just blindly say to someone that everything is going to be fine, because that just shows arrogance and it shows how naive you are. Life doesn't always work that way, sometimes it won't be alright, and sadly for some it will only be alright when their heart stops beating. That's when their pain will finally disappear. So the next time you want to help someone or reassure them, don't blindly say it'll be alright, but actually consider their feelings and walk them through it, reassure them every step of the way. Show them that although you may or may not know what they are going through that you will be there for them. JoshuaGnzon January 23, 2012   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: I get up at seven, yeah, and I go to work at nine.; I got no time for livin', yes, I'm workin' all the time.; ; It seems to me I could live my life; A lot better than I think I am.; I guess that's why they call me; They call me the working man.; They call me the working man.; I guess that's what I am.; ; So I get home at five o'clock and I take myself out a nice, cold beer.; Always seem to be wond'rin' why there's nothin' goin' down here.; ; It seems to me I could live my life; A lot better than I think I am.; I guess that's why they call me; The working man.; Well, they call me the working man.; I guess that's what I am.; ; Well, they call me the working man.; I guess that's what I am.; ; I get up at seven, yeah, and I go to work at nine.; I got no time for livin', yes, I'm workin' all the time.; ; It seems to me I could live my life; A lot better than I think I am.; I guess that's why they call me; They call me the working man.; Well, they call me the working man.; I guess that's what I am.; ; They call me the working man.; I guess that's what I am.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been working for a long time, and he's trying to live his life a lot better than he thinks he is. It seems to me I could live my life a much better than I think I am. I guess that's why they call me the working man. "I get home at five o'clock and I take myself out a nice cold beer. Always seem to be wond'rin why there's nothin' goin' down here." This song reminds me of a friend of mine who is working for him. He's working at the same time as me, and it's hard for me to get out of bed at five, but it's worth it. I'm not sure if he's working, or not, but I'm pretty sure he's not working because he's tired of working, and that's what he's doing. I think he's talking about how he wants to be with his friends, but he doesn't want to work. He wants to live life to the fullest, and to be able to do that. He doesn't know what to do with his life, and doesn't have the time to do it, so he goes to work at nine, and then goes to sleep at nine. He has no time for livin' all the time. I don't know if it's a metaphor or a metaphor, but the song is a metaphor for how he feels about his job, and how he's feeling about his life. He feels like he could be a better person than he is, but if he was working, he wouldn't be the same person he is now. He would have no time to live, or to work, or be happy, because he'd be alone.
Ground Truth: I agree that instrumentally it sounds very much like Zep, but I still don't know how people could think it was a new song by them. I mean, c'mon, Geddy and Plant don't sound anything alike...byteskaton June 05, 2008

Lyrics: Sucker love is heaven sent; You pucker up, our passion's spent; My heart's a tart, your body's rent; My body's broken, yours is bent; ; Carve your name into my arm; Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed; Cause there's nothing else to do; Every me and every you; ; Sucker love, a box I choose; No other box I choose to use; Another love I would abuse; No circumstances could excuse; ; In the shape of things to come; Too much poison come undone; Cause there's nothing else to do; Every me and every you; Every me and every you; Every me... he; ; Sucker love is known to swing; Prone to cling and waste these things; Pucker up for heavens sake; There's never been so much at stake; I serve my head up on a plate; It's only comfort, calling late; Cause there's nothing else to do; Every me and every you; Every me and every you; Every me... he; Every me and every you; Every me... he; ; Like the naked leads the blind; I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind; Sucker love I always find; Someone to bruise and leave behind; ; All alone in space and time; There's nothing here but what here's mine; Something borrowed, something blue; Every me and every you; Every me and every you; Every me... he; Every me and every you; Every me... he; Every me and every you; Every me... he; Every me and every you; Every me... he; Every me and every you; Every me... he; Every me and every you; Every me... he
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is cheating on his wife. He is in love with her but she doesn't want to admit it. He wants her to leave him, but he doesn't. So he leaves her and he wants her back.

Ground Truth: AllStarMe - is that because you witnessed the powerful talents of Appleyard skating to it on Sorry and hearing the song makes you want to skate like that? I heard this song on Cruel Intentions first and listened to it a bit at the time, now I listen to it again with the Flip vid bringing it back to my attention - great song but I can't really say I'm into Placebo that much.

Lyrics: Brainstorm, take me away from the norm; I've got to tell you something; This phenomenon; I had to put it in a song and it goes like; ; Whoa; Amber is the color of your energy; Whoa; Shades of gold displayed naturally; ; You ought to know what brings me here; You glide through my head blind to fear and I know why; ; Whoa; Amber is the color of your energy; Whoa; Shades of gold displayed naturally; ; Whoa; Amber is the color of your energy; Whoa; Shades of gold displayed naturally; ; You live too far away; Your voice rings like a bell anyway; Don't give up your independence, unless it feels so right; Nothing good comes easily, sometimes you've got to fight; ; Whoa; Amber is the color of your energy; Whoa; Shades of gold displayed naturally; Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy; Still, it's fine from afar, and you know that; Whoa; Brainstorm, take me away from the norm; Whoa; I've got to tell you something
Sample outputs: I think this song is about someone who is in a relationship with someone, but they don't know what to do about it. They don't want to give up their independence, unless it feels so rightNothing good comes easilySometimes you've got to fightWhoa Amber is the color of your energyWhoaAmber is a color of my heart, so easyStill it's fine from afarAnd you know thatWhoa Brainstorm, take me away from the normWhoaBrainstormTake me awayFrom the normYou live too far awayYour voice rings like a bell anywayDon't give up your independenceUnless it feel so rightnothing good comes easySometimes you have to fightI think the song is talking about someone that is in love with someone and doesn't want them to know that they're in love, and they want to help them get over it and move on.
Ground Truth: The first few times I listened to this song, I thought he said "rainstorm" instead of "brainstorm". I have to admit that I would've liked it a little more if "rainstorm" was in place of "brainstorm"... but the song is still very awesome. It reminds me very much of the beach and the ocean. weirdfisheson December 02, 2007   
Lyrics: I stepped out onto the midway. I was looking for the pirate; ship and saw this small, old tent at one end. It was blue,; and had white lights hanging all around it. I decided to check; out the tent, it seemed I could hear music coming from inside.; As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow.; I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line. I; pulled back the drape thing on the tent. There was a crystal; ball at the table, and behind it, a girl wearing a hat. She; smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read. I said okay,; and sat down. I thought about it for a minute, and asked her; if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead.; ; Creeping up into the sky. Stopping, at the top and,; starting down. The girl grabbed my hand, I clutched it; tight. I said good-bye to the ground.; ; Far below, a soiled man. A bucket of torn tickets at his side.; He watches as the children run by. And picks his teeth. Spinning; 'Round, my head begins to turn. I shouted, and searched the sky; for a friend. I heard the fortune teller, screaming back at me.; We stuck out our hands, and met the winds.; ; The girl falters as she steps down from the platform. She; clutches her stomach, and begins to heave. The ticket-taker; smiles, and the last car is ready. Who told you that you; could leave?; ; The sun was setting by the time we left. We walked across; the deserted lot, alone. We were tired, but we managed to smile.; At the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller. The; carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face, but I could; tell she was blushing.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a man, but she doesn't want to go on the roller coaster. She wants to get away from him, but he wants to go with her, so she leaves him. I think it's about a guy who wants to be with a girl, but the girl doesn't really want him, so he goes on a roller coaster instead. And he wants her to leave him, and he tells her that he doesn't care about her, and that he's going to leave her for a friend. But the part about the girl is about how he's asking her if she would rather go to the rollercoaster instead. It's about how the guy is trying to convince the girl that she's a good friend, and she's trying to tell him that she wants him to leave, and the girl wants to know why he's leaving her. "I thought about it for a minute, and asked her, if she'd rather go on a coaster instead." He doesn't know why she would want to wait in line. "The girl grabbed my hand, I clutched it tight. I said good-bye to the ground." He knows that she isn't going to let him go, and it's too late. "He watches as the children run byAnd picks his teeth. Spinning 'Round, my head begins to turn. I shouted, and searched the sky for the fortune teller, screaming back at me. We stuck out our hands, and met the winds." The girl falters as she steps down from the platform. She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave. The ticket-taker smiles and the last car is ready. Who told you that you could leave? The sun was setting by the time we left. We walked across the deserted lot, alone. We were tired, but we managed to smile. At the gate I saidgoodnight to the fortune tellinger. The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face, but I could tell she was blushing.

Lyrics: Its been a long year; Since we last spoke.; How's your halo?; Just between you and I; You and me and the satellites; I never believed you; I only wanted to; Before all of this; What did I miss?; Do you ever get homesick?; I can't get used to it; I can't get used to it; I'll never get used to it; I'll never get used to it; I'm under that night; I'm under those same stars; We're in a red car; You asleep at my side; Going in and out of the headlights; Could I have saved you?; Would that 've betrayed you?; I want to burn this film; you alone with those pills.; what you couldn't do I will; I forgive you.; I'll forgive you; I'll forgive you; I'll forgive you; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.; For blue, blue skies; I'll forgive you.
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl and she can't get used to it. He wants to get over it, but he doesn't want to. He's asking her to forgive him, but she says she doesn't. "I want to burn this filmYou alone with those pillsWhat you couldn't do I willI forgive you"I think he's saying that he'll forgive her, but that he's not going to let her go. "You and me and the satellitesI never believed youI only wanted toBefore all of thisWhat did I missDo you ever get homesick?" I think he means that she's trying to get rid of him, and she's not willing to give him what he's asking for. She's saying, "I'll forgive you, for blue, blue skies." I think she's talking about the fact that he is trying to convince her to let him go, and that he can't do it, because he knows that he will never be able to do it. I don't think he was trying to make her feel better, but I think that's what it means.
Ground Truth: "I want to burn this filmYou alone with those pillsWhat you couldn't do I will"He wants to burn the home videos of him and his brother because he's hurt that his brother choose drugs over him. So he's telling his brother he's going to take a stand. sierradawnon February 15, 2014   Link1 Reply 
Lyrics: I tried to do handstands for you; I tried to do headstands for you; Everytime I fell you on yeah everytime I fell; I tried to do handstands for you; But everytime I fell for you; I'm permanently black and blue; permanently blue for you; ; I tried to do handstands for you; I tried to do headstands for you; Everytime I fell on you yeah everytime I fell; I tried to do handstands; But everytime I fell for you; I'm permanently black and blue; permanently blue for; You-ooo...; ; For you-ooo...; ; So black and blue-oooo...; For you-ooo...; I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruisy knees; But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like; ; All those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruisy knees; Hot July ain't good to me; ; I'm pink and black and blue; ; I got bruises on my knees for you; And grass stains on my knees for you; Got holes in my new jeans for you; ; Got pink and black and blue; Got bruises on my knees for you; And grass stains on my knees for you; Got holes in my new jeans for you; Got pink and black and blue for; You-ooo...; For you-ooo...; So black and blue-ooo ...; For you-oooo ...; Do-doo-do-do-do; Do-doo-do-do-do...; Do-doo-do-do-do...; Do-doo-do-do-do; Do-doo-do-do-do...; Do-doo-do-do-do; Do-doo-do-do-do...; Do-doo-do-do-do
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who falls in love with a girl and he tries to do handstands for her. He wants to do headstands, but he doesn't want to do it. "I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruisy kneesBut frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste likeAll those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruise kneesHot July ain't good to meI'm pink and black and blueI got bruises on my knees for youGot holes in my new jeans for you"I think it's about how he's trying to get her to stop falling in love, and that he wants her to get away from him, but she doesn't. "And grass stains on my knee for you." That's how I see it. I think he's saying that he's going to get hurt, and he wants to get rid of her. I don't think that's the right way to interpret it, but I think it could be.
Ground Truth: The song is about making love outdoors. Bruises on knees, grass, hot summer, holes in jeans, etc. If you've done it, you'll know what she's talking about. The whole "handstand" deal, i don't think it's meant to be taken literally... but i understand ;) and I hope you do too. spj36on October 05, 2008
