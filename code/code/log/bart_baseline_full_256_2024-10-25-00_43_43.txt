Lyrics: In the first days; Of the springtime; Made you a prince with a thousand enemies; Made a trail of; A thousand tears; Made you a prisoner inside your own secrecy.; ; There's a ghost in me; Who wants to say I'm sorry; Doesn't mean I'm sorry; ; At the first hour; Of the springtime; Made you a prince with a thousand enemies; Now I see you; From the corner; Clock strikes and I know you will be drinking alone; ; There's a ghost in me; Who wants to say I'm sorry; Doesn't mean I'm sorry There's a ghost in me; Who wants to say I'm sorry; Doesn't mean I'm sorry There's a ghost in me; Who wants to say I'm sorry; Doesn't mean I'm sorry There's a ghost in me; Who wants to say I'm sorry; Doesn't mean I'm sorry End
Sample outputs: This song is about a guy who has had a bad relationship with a girl, and he wants to say he's sorry, but she doesn't want to say anything. He wants to tell her that he is sorry. He says that he loves her, but he knows that she will be drinking alone. He doesn't know what to do, so he doesn't say anything to her. He just wants her to tell him that she's sorry and that he's not going to be able to be with her anymore. He goes on to say that he knows he's going to have to say something, but that he won't. He knows that he'll have to do something to get her to say it. He tells her that it doesn't mean anything, because he knows she's not sorry for what she did to him. He's saying that he can't do anything about it, and that she won't be with him anymore, because she's hurt him so badly. He realizes that he isn't sorry for how he treated her, and how he feels about her. "There's a ghost in meWho wants to Say I'm SorryDoesn't mean I'm sorryEnd"This is just my interpretation of the song. I don't think it's a love song, but it's about a relationship that doesn't work out. It's about how he's hurt her, that he regrets what he did to her because he didn't want her to go through with it. The "ghost in me" in the chorus is that he feels sorry for himself, but the "ghost" in him doesn't really mean anything anymore. I think that's why he's saying "I'm sorry" to her, because that's what he feels. The ghost in him is saying that she is sorry for everything, and it's not meant to be. "I know you will be staying alone"He's saying to her that she'll always be there for him. "You're a prisoner inside your own secrecy"I think this is about how she feels about him. She wants him to say, "I am sorry" because she knows he'll never forgive her. She's trying to get him to forgive her for everything he has done for her. That's what I think of it.
Ground Truth: I think the person was in a relationship,and then she breaks up with them and the're alone,"and I know you will be drinking alone",and she wants to tell them shes sorry,but deep down she isnt,and wanted whats best for her. alexbarclayon September 03, 2008   
Lyrics: I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard; Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact; That everyone can see these scars; I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel; But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you; To just believe this is real; So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do; Face away and pretend I'm not; But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got; ; I can't feel the way I did before; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; Time won't heal this damage anymore; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; ; I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident; 'Cause you don't understand I do what I can; But sometimes I don't make sense; I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt; It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you; For once just to hear me out; So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do; You face away and pretend I'm not; But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got; ; I can't feel the way I did before; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; Time won't heal this damage anymore; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; ; You hear me out now; You're gonna listen to me like it or not; Right now, hear me out now; You're gonna listen to me like it or not; Right now; ; I can't feel the way I did before; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; ; I can't feel the way I did before; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; Time won't heal this damage anymore; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; ; I can't feel...; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored; Time won't heal...; Don't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a relationship that has been going on for so long that he can't get over it. He wants to forget about it, but he doesn't want to. He can't. He knows he's wrong, and he knows it's wrong. But he's not going to turn his back on her. He's going to tell her that he loves her, and that he'll be there for her, because she's all that he's got. So he's saying that he won't be ignored. He is saying that no matter what he does, he'll always be here for her. "I can't feel the way I did before,Don't turn your back on me, I won’t be ignored"He's telling her that she's wrong because she doesn't love him. "You hear me out now,You're gonna listen to me like it or not"He knows that she loves him, but she can't convince him to let go of her. She can't turn her back on him. He doesn't know what to do, and she knows that he’s wrong. He’ll be here, because he wants her to love him back.
Ground Truth: I hate to tell you this and y but all there music is not good.They started out ok,but faint is one of the few songs worth listening to on meteora.Its only good because its not like 90% of there stuff,with widely relatable lyrics and slightly louder than celine dion chorus.

Lyrics: Honey, why you calling me so late?; It's kinda of hard to talk right now; Honey, why you crying? Is everything OK?; I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud; ; Oh well, my girl's in the next room; Sometimes, I wish she was you; I guess we never really moved on; ; It's really good to hear your voice saying my name; It sounds so sweet; Coming from the lips of an angel; Hearing those words it makes me weak; And I never want to say goodbye; But girl, you make it hard to be faithful; With the lips of an angel; ; It's funny that you're calling me tonight; And yes, I dreamt of you too; Does he know you're talking to me?; Will it start a fight?; No, I don't think she has a clue; ; Oh well, my girl's in the next room; Sometimes, I wish she was you; I guess we never really moved on; ; It's really good to hear your voice saying my name; It sounds so sweet; Coming from the lips of an angel; Hearing those words; it makes me weak; And I never wanna say goodbye; But girl, you make it hard to be faithful; With the lips of an angel; ; It's really good to hear your voice saying my name; It sounds so sweet; Coming from the lips of an angel; Hearing those words; it makes me weak; And I never wanna say goodbye; But girl, you make it hard to be faithful; With the lips of an angel; And I never wanna say goodbye; But girl, you make it hard to be faithful; With the lips of an angel; Honey, why you calling me so late?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who's in love with a girl, but he doesn't want her to be with him anymore. He wants her to know that he loves her, but she doesn't know what to do with him. He's trying to tell her that he can't be with her anymore, and that he's not going to let her go. "It's really good to hear your voice saying my nameIt sounds so sweetComing from the lips of an angelHearing those words it makes me weakAnd I never want to say goodbyeBut girl, you make it hard to be faithfulWith the lips Of an angelIt's funny that you're calling me tonightAnd yes, I dreamt of you tooDoes he know you're talking to me? Will it start a fight? No, I don't think she has a clue"He's saying that he wants her back, but that she's not telling him that she wants him back, and he's telling her that she can't leave him. "Oh well, my girl's in the next roomSometimes, I wish she was youI guess we never really moved on"He is saying that they're going to be together again, but they don't want to be alone. "She's saying her name to me, and I never wanna say goodbye"I think he's saying this because he's afraid that he won't be able to do anything about it, or that he'll hurt her. "Honey, why you calling me so late?" He's saying, "I wish you was you, I guess I never really got on with you." He's not sure if he wants to leave her, or if he's just trying to get her back. "I got to whisper, cause I can’t be too loud"I'm not sure how he feels about this, but I think it's a good song. It's a great song, and it makes him feel like he's finally done with her.
Ground Truth: I adore this song. It has great lyrics and great music, I agree with punk_rock_chiki on the meaning. I can't decide whether this is good or bad, but I was in the exact same situation as the singer in this song, to a T. This song helped me a lot and certainly meant a lot to me.

Lyrics: I've found the center of fruit is late; is the center of truth today.; I cut the apple in two.; Oh, I pray it isn't true.; ; I've found the center of fruit is late; is the center of truth today.; Cut the apple in two.; Oh, I pray it isn't true.; ; I've got something you can never eat.; I've got something you can never eat.; I've got something you can never eat.; I've got something you can never eat.; ; I've drained my heart, I've burned my soul.; I've trained the core to stop my growth.; I pray to die in space,; to cover me in snow,; to cover me in snow,; cover me in snow,; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; cover me in snow.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.; ; Take this from me.; Hate me.

Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a girl and wants to kill her but he can't because he's afraid of losing her. "I've found the center of fruit is late"He's saying that he's going to die in space, to cover me in snow, because he knows he's dying too. "Take this from me, Hate me. Hate me." He's trying to convince himself that he doesn't want to die, but he knows that he has to do something. "Cover me in Snow, I'm dying, I hope you're dying too." He knows that if he kills her, he'll die too. He knows he'll never be able to save her. He's saying he's not going to let go of her, because she's dying. He wants to leave her, and he wants her to be with him. "He can't move just stand still." He hopes that she will die, and that he'll be happy. "You've drained my heart, I've burned my soul. I've trained the core to stop my growth." He is saying that she can't do anything, and she wants him to die because he is afraid of her. She's saying "I hope you die too" and "I'm going to leave you alone, and I hope that you're not dying, too." She's telling him that she doesn't know what to do, but that she's willing to do anything to save him. He is telling her that she'll never see him again, because if she dies, he will die. "One, 2, 3, he is a speed bump mannequin." He doesn't have to move just standing still. He just can't. He can't make her feel better. "1,2, 3" he is trying to kill himself, but she's afraid he'll kill himself. "2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 19, 22, 21, 24, 23, 25, 24. I think he's saying to himself that she is dying because he cannot do anything about her, so he's just going to stand still. "
Ground Truth: i think this song (obvious as it may be) is just about how god gave us all these things to desire and crave, but if we ever take them, we're damned. i think, "i'll cut the apple in two, oh I pray it isn't true," is Marilyn saying that he could resist temptation if it wasn't so appealing. if the apple was cut for him and ready to be taken by him, he wouldn't want it so bad. the way he says "i've got something you can never eat," sounds taunting, so i think thats god saying, "yeah here are all these wonderful sins, but if you give in to them, you're going to hell." great song. kill.me.fasteron August 10, 2002   
Lyrics: It's really hard; I can't cry in your arms; 'Cause you're not here; It's not your fault; And if it was I wouldn't care; ; My heart is bigger than the distance; In between us; I know it 'cause I feel it beating; ; So strong it'll knock you down; ; So strong, so strong; Over here; ; I can count the miles away; From where I wanna be; I bet your skin is warm; And that you're smiling; Yeah, that's what I always loved; ; The most about you; So strong come and knock me down; Hey!; Baby if I'm half the man I say I am; ; If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am; Then I'll believe in what you say; There's nothing left for you to do; The only proof that I need is you; ; I'll get in my car; ; Driving faster than I ever did before; Head out west until I finally reach the shore; And then I'll swim back to wherever you are; And we'll ride the under current down to the floor; Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures; ; Pushing back on the unnecessary pressure; Come up for air just so you know we won't drown; We're so strong, the world can't keep us out; Hey!; ; Baby if I'm half the man I say I am; If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am; Then I'll believe in what you say; There's nothing left for you to do; The only proof that I need is you; Yeah, ooh yeah; ; Yeah, ooh yeah; ; So do you love me (Yeah); All you gotta do is say yes; Now do you love me (Yeah); And I won't ever second guess; Now do you love me (Yeah); ; All you gotta do is say yes; Now do you love me (Yeah); Then you've already proved it; Yeah, yeah; Baby if I'm half the man I say I am; If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am; Then I'll believe in what you say; There's nothing left for you to do; The only proof that I need is; Baby if I'm half the man I say I am; If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am; Then I'll believe in what you say; There's nothing left for you to do; The only proof that I need is you
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but he doesn't want to be with her. He wants her to love him, but she can't be with him because she's afraid of losing him. "Baby if I'm half the man I say I amIf I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I amThen I'll believe in what you sayThere's nothing left for you to doThe only proof that I need is you"He's saying that he loves her, and he wants to give her what she wants. "I'll get in my car, driving faster than I ever did beforeHead out west until I finally reach the shoreAnd then I'll swim back to wherever you areAnd we'll ride the under current down to the floorMaking friends with all the unfamiliar creaturesPushing back on the unnecessary pressureCome up for air just so you know we won't drownWe're so strong, the world can't keep us outHey!

He loves her so much that he can’t let go of her. “I won't ever second guessNow do you love me”This is a beautiful song. I love it. I think it is a great song.
Ground Truth: I think this song is about being away from the person you love and hearing rumors about all of the things they're doing while they're away from you. Instead of believing the rumors she has complete faith in her loved one. "It’s really hard, I can’t cry in your arms ‘cause you’re not here. It’s not your fault and if it was I wouldn’t care. My heart is bigger than the distance in-between us. I know it ‘cause I feel it beating." -She's sad because he's gone for a reason that he couldn't control but her love for him is bigger than the distance. "So strong it'll knock you down. So strong, so strong." -Talking about her love. "Over here, I can't count the miles away, from where I wanna be." -She wishes she could be where he is. "I bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling. Yeah, that’s what I always loved the most about you. You’re so strong come and knock me down, hey." -She's thinking of her favorite things about him. "Baby, if I’m half the man I say I am if I’m a woman with no fear just like I claim I am. Then I believe in what you say there’s nothing left for you to do. The only proof that I need is you." -If she's as strong as she says then she'll believe what he says not the rumors because she trusts him and he's the only proof she needs. "I’ll get in my car drive it faster than I ever did before. Head out west until I finally reach the shore. And then I’ll swim out to wherever you are." -She misses him so much that she willing to swim across the ocean to him. "And we'll ride the undercurrent down to the floor. Making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures and pushing back all the unnecessary pressure. Come up for air just so you know we won’t drown." -She's saying that they can just take a break from the world, make new friends and forget about all of the pressure. "You’re so strong. The world can't keep us down, hey!" -What other people say won't effect us. "So do you love me? All you gotta do is say yes. Now do you love me? And I won’t ever second guess. Now do you love me? All you gotta do is say yes.

Lyrics: Though I'd like to be the girl for him; And cross the sea and land for him; Milky skin, my tongue is sand until; The iridescent band begins to play; ; He's my Brandy Alexander; Always gets me into trouble; But that's another matter; Brandy Alexander; He's my Brandy Alexander; Always gets me into trouble; But that's another matter; Brandy Alexander; ; Though I know what I love most of him; I'm walking on needles and pins; My addiction to the worst of him; The low moon helps me sing; ; I'm his Brandy Alexander; Always get him into trouble; I hide that I am flattered; Brandy Alexander; I'm his Brandy Alexander; Always get him into trouble; I hide that I am flattered; Brandy Alexander; ; It goes down easy; You go down easy; It goes down easy; It goes down easy; You go down easy; You go down easy; You go down easy; You go down easy; ; Brandy Alexander
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl, but she doesn't want to be with him. He wants to be the girl for him and cross the sea and land for him. Milky skin, my tongue is sand until the iridescent band begins to play. He's my Brandy Alexander. Always gets me into trouble. But that's another matter. Brandy Alex. I think this is a reference to a girl who is addicted to drugs, and she's trying to get him into trouble, but it doesn't work. She's addicted to the worst of him. The low moon helps me sing. I'm his brandy Alexander, always get him in trouble. I hide that I am flattered. She hides that she is flattered, because she knows that she's flattered by the guy. She knows that he's not the best guy for her, and that she needs to get over him. She can't get him out of her head, because he's so obsessed with her. But she can't help it, because it's the only way she can get him to get out of it. She doesn't know what she loves about him, but that's what she does. She just wants him to be happy.
Ground Truth: this is such a sweet adorable song. i love the "it goes down easy" part. i think the easy-going tone also affects the meaning of the song.. think of it as casual love thing.. maybe? p.s. i wish i were gay, i'd TOTALLY bang feist. hab204on June 28, 2007   
Lyrics: Is it alive? Does it writhe?; Can it survive under the sun?; I can't put my finger on it; ; Is it green? Is it red?; Is it alive or is it dead?; I can't put my finger on it; ; Scathe with a lathe; All the days in the past; I can't put my finger on it; ; Is it black? Is it white?; Is it really outta sight?; I can't put my finger on it, oh; ; Can it squeal, does it squirm?; If it's fresh will it burn?; I can't put my finger on it; ; Can it fly, will it try?; If the wings are still wet?; I can't put my finger on it; ; Can it heal, is it real; Can it feel the threads of time?; I can't put my finger on it?; ; Does it glow, will it shine; Does it leave a trail of slime; I can't put my finger on it?; ; Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?; I said, are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?; Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?; Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?; ; Is it alive? Does it writhe?; Can it survive under the sun?; I can't put my finger on it; ; Is it green? Is it red?; Is it alive or is it dead?; I can't put my finger on it; ; Scathe with a lathe; All the days in the past; I can't put my finger on it; ; Is it black? Is it white?; Is it really outta sight?; I can't put my finger on it
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a dwarf. It's a dwarf, and the dwarf is the only thing that can make it survive under the sun. I can't put my finger on it. I don't think it's the dwarf, but I think it could be. I think that the dwarf could be a hallucinogen. It could also be a parasite, or something like that. I'm not really sure, but it's possible that it could have a hallucination. I like to think that it's a halluc hallucinogenic, and that the hallucinogens could be something like LSD, or some kind of hallucination, but that's just my take on it, and I think I've seen enough of it, so I'm going to leave it at that. Also, I think the line "Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside?" could be referring to the dwarf itself, which could be an acid, or a drug. It might also be the dwarf that you can see when you're in a dream, and you can't get it out of your head, because it's so hard for you to see it, because you can only see it from a dream perspective. It also could be about the dwarf being alive, but the only way you can really see it is if it's alive, or it's dead. If it's fresh, will it burn? I can’t put my fingers on it because it’s hard to see. I’m not sure if this is a reference to LSD or not, but this is what I think. So yeah, this is probably my favorite song on the album, and it's definitely one of the best.
Ground Truth: I think it's definitely about a clitoris, but the beauty is that it doesn't have to be taken as that way. It can just as easily be interpreted as being about the things in life and this world that we can't define or explain, and that not being able to put one's finger on it is that same as not being able to wrap one's mind around a particular concept. Personally though, I think Gener's having some trouble finding the G-spot and having some lyrical fun whilst trying to find it. DoYouRealiseon October 03, 2011   
Lyrics: Yesterday has been and gone; Tommorow will I find the sun; or will it rain; Everybody's having fun; Except me I'm the lonely one; I live in shame; ; I said goodbye to romance, yeah; Goodbye to friends, I tell you; Goodbye to all the past; I guess that we'll meet; we'll meet in the end; ; I've been the king, I've been the clown; now broken wings can't hold me down; I'm free again; The jester with the broken crown; It won't be me this time around; to love in vain; ; I said goodbye to romance, yeah; Goodbye to friends, I tell you; Goodbye to all the past; I guess that we'll meet; we'll meet in the end; ; and I feel the time is right; although I know that you just might say to me; what you gonna do; what you gonna do; But I have to take this chance; goodbye to friends and to romance; And to all of you; And to all of you; Come'on now!; ; I said goodbye to romance, yeah; Goodbye to friends, I tell you; Goodbye to all the past; I guess that we'll meet; we'll meet in the end; ; and the winter is looking fine; and I think the sun will shine again; and I feel I've cleaned my mind; all the past is left behind again; I said goodbye to romance, yeah; Goodbye to friends, I tell you; Goodbye to all the past; I guess that we'll meet; we'll meet in the end
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who has been in love with a girl for a long time, but she doesn't want to be with him anymore, so he says goodbye to friends and to romance and to all of you. I think the winter is looking fine, and i think the sun will shine again, and I feel I've cleaned my mind, all the past is left behind again. The jester with the broken crown, it won't be me this time around, to love in vain.
Ground Truth: Yeah, as above comments say, the song is about missing what has past (Time with Sabbath) but looking forward to a better future (Solo Career and time with his family). This song also features a beautiful Guitar Solo from the late great guitarist Randy Rhoads... Gone but not forgotton...Hunter_14180on March 13, 2005   
Lyrics: Don't you have a word to show what may be done; Have you never heard a way to find the sun; Tell me all that you may know; Show me what you have to show; Won't you come and say; If you know the way to blue?; ; Have you seen the land living by the breeze; Can you understand a light among the trees; Tell me all that you may know; Show me what you have to show; Tell us all today; If you know the way to blue?; ; Look through time and find your rhyme; Tell us what you find; We will wait at your gate; Hoping like the blind.; ; Can you now recall all that you have known?; Will you never fall; When the light has flown?; Tell me all that you may know; Show me what you have to show; Won't you come and say; If you know the way to blue?
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a man who is in love with a girl, but he doesn't know how to show her the way to love him. He's trying to convince her that he can show her how to love her, but she can't do it. "Have you seen the land living by the breezeCan you understand a light among the treesShow me all that you may knowShow me what you have to showTell us all todayIf you know the wayTo blue"He is trying to get her to show him how she can love him and tell him that she loves him. "Look through time and find your rhymeTell us what you findWe will wait at your gateHoping like the blindCan you now recallall that you have knownWill you never fallWhen the light has flownTell me all you have learnedWill you come and sayif you know this way to blue?" He is telling her that she can tell him if she knows the right way to be with him, and that she should wait for him to come to her gate and tell her how she feels about him. She is asking him to tell her all that he has to show, and he is asking her to tell him how to feel about him, because he is not sure if he will be able to do that. He is asking the girl if she will ever fall, and she is saying that she will never fall, because she is the only one who can help her. "Will you ever fall"He's asking her not to fall, but to wait for the light to fly. He wants her to remember all that she has known, and to be happy with him because she has never fall. He asks her to wait at the gate, hoping that the light will fly. "Hoping like the Blind"He wants to know if she is ready to fall and if she has ever fallen, and if he is able to find her, he will wait for her to come back to him.
Ground Truth: I understand that the majority of people would say '' blue can't be related to sadness because he won't try to get it intentionally'',well, that's a reasonable thought, but there another way to see the messagge of this song: nick would get depressed about how stupid things are in this stupid and material world full of stupid and unsensitive people, and he could only find happiness by his own in nature. Hence,''If you know the way to blue?'' means, after enumerateing a few nature element like the sun, the trees, the softly breeze, he's saying ''how can you feel down among these beautiful things?'' It'slike a process he would do after feeling down, he would go to a park, sit under the trees, just like Baudelaire's Recollection, and feel well againjustnickon February 04, 2011   
Lyrics: They made up their minds; And they started packing; They left before the sun came up that day; An exit to eternal summer slacking; But where were they going without ever knowing the way; ; They drank up the wine; And they got to talking; They now had more important things to say; And when the car broke down; They started walking; Where were they going without ever knowing the way; ; Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold; And it's always summer; They'll never get cold; They'll never get hungry; They'll never get old and gray; You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere; They won't make it home; But they really don't care; They wanted the highway; They're happier there today; ; Their children woke up; And they couldn't find 'em; They left before the sun came up that day; They just drove off and left it all behind 'em; Leaving it all behind; But where were they going without ever knowing the way?; ; Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold; And it's always summer; They'll never get cold; They'll never get hungry; They'll never get old and gray; You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere; They won't make it home; But they really don't care; They wanted the highway; They're happier there today; ; Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold; And it's always summer; They'll never get cold; They'll never get hungry; They'll never get old and gray; You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere; They won't make it home; But they really don't care; They wanted the highway; They're happier there today; Today...
Sample outputs: I think it's about a couple who are in love with each other. They've made up their minds and they started packing. They left before the sun came up that day. An exit to eternal summer slacking. But where were they going without ever knowing the way? They drank up the wine and they got to talking. They now had more important things to say. And when the car broke down. They started walking. Where were they gonna go without everknow the way. Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold. And it's always summer. They'll never get cold. They’ll never get hungry. They won’t get old and gray. You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere. They wont make it home. But they really don't care. They wanted the highway, they’re happier there today. Their children woke up. And they couldn’�t find them. They just drove off and left it all behind them. Leaving it’s all behind. They're happier there now. They want the highway. Today, they are happier there than ever before. Anyways, I think this song is about a guy and a girl who have been together for a long time. They have a lot of problems, and they want to get away from it all. They need to get out of it, but they can't. They think they want the road, they want it to be the way they used to be. They know they will never be happy there today, they just want to leave it behind.
Ground Truth: this is about how great its is to hear music like this fastball really out did them selfs with this song i love this song its in one of my top 5 songs ever if your real what to know what i think i think its about freedom how someone can just pick up one day and just go go any where they want and dont carecojox33on February 27, 2008

Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy, but she can't take it anymore. She's going away, she's going to go away, and she won't be able to love him anymore. "What's wrong with my life today? She's gonna go away"I think it's about a guy who is going to get a girl, but he doesn't want to let her go, because he can't handle it anymore, and he's sick of it. "I'm a loner, I'm a loser, I’m a winnerIn my mindI’'m a bad one"I'm not sure what this means, but I think it could be about a relationship, or a relationship.
Ground Truth: hmm.maybe im just weird, but when i first listened to it i thought it was more of..maybe..he loved her but she left him or wronged him somehow and now she's going away, and when he say "she's going away,whats wrong with my life today" i think hes saying more of, now that she isnt here whats wrong with my life? like he's kinda happy i guess...crazygurrlon December 18, 2009   Link1 Reply

Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a man, but he can't get enough of her. She's in a bad relationship with him, but she doesn't want to give up. She wants him to be happy with her, but it's hard for him to get over her. "Hold it between your legsTurn it up, turn it upThe wind is coming throughCan’t get enoughA lonely lifeWhere no one understands youBut don't give upBecause the music doAnd then it's reaching inside youForever preachingFuck you tooYour scream's a whisperHang on youTwisted transistorHey you, hey youFinally you get itThe world ain't fairEat you if you let itAnd as your tears fall onYour breasts, your dressVibrations coming throughYou're in a messA sad life where no one understand youButDon't give give upbecause the music doesAnd then, it'sreaching inside youforever preachingfuck you tooyour screams a whisper Hang on youtwisted transistorI think it's about a guy who has been in a relationship with a girl for so long, and he doesn't know what to do with her anymore, and she's telling him to just let her go, because he won't hurt her anymore. He's telling her that she can't let go of him, and that she won't let him be between you and me, don't fit. He wants to be with her forever, but even though he knows she's hurting him, he still wants to have sex with her. He just wants her to know that he loves her, even though she's hurt him so much.
Ground Truth: Just leave korn alone...so they wrote one weird and odd song, so what? They are still metal, listen to the guitar! There are other songs on the album that prove their awesomeness like Coming Undone and Hypocrites. KoRn is meant to be different, I mean look at thier god damn name!! Think about it, Freak on a Leash? They are trying to be odd, and it is obviously working. I don't think anyone will truly know what Twisted Transistor really means, unless the band themselves tells the world. You can get whatever you feel out of it and that's the point, enjoyment. If you don't enjoy it, DON'T LISTEN TO THEM. KoRn rules! guitarfan531on June 07, 2007   
Lyrics: Watch out Cupid; Stuck me with a sickness; Pull your little arrows out; And let me live my life; ; You better watch out Cupid; Stuck me with a sickness; Pull your little arrows out; Let me live my life; The one I better lead; All the blondes of fantasies; ; And we looked at them; Eleven ways; You said "look at me"; I looked away; You wrote the song; I wanna play; I'll write you harmony in C; ; Everybody; Everybody just wanna fall in love; Everybody; Everybody just wanna play the lead; Everybody; Everybody just wanna fall in love; Everybody; Everybody just wanna play the lead; Play the lead; Play the lead; ; Watch out Cupid; Money is a sick muse; Pull your little arrows out; And let me live my life; ; She said I'm with stupid; Money is a sick muse; Pull your little arrows out; Let me live my life; The one I better lead; All the blondes of fantasies; ; And we looked at them; Eleven ways; You said "look at me"; I looked away; You wrote the song; I wanna play; I'll write you harmony in C; ; Everybody; Everybody just wanna fall in love; Everybody; Everybody just wanna play the lead; Everybody; Everybody just wanna fall in love; Everybody; Everybody just wanna play the lead; Play the lead; Play the lead; ; I'll write you harmony in C; ; Everybody; Everybody just wanna fall in love; Everybody; Everybody just wanna play the lead; Everybody; Everybody just wanna fall in love; Everybody; Everybody just wanna play the lead; Play the lead; Play the lead
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a girl who is in love with a guy, but she doesn't want to be with him because she wants to be the one who leads the world. "Watch out CupidStuck me with a sicknessPull your little arrows outLet me live my lifeThe one I better leadAll the blondes of fantasiesAnd we looked at themEleven waysYou said look at meI looked awayYou wrote the songI wanna playI'll write you harmony in CEverybody just wanna fall in loveEverybodyJust wanna play the leadEverybodyEverybody just want to fall inloveEverybodyEverybodyJust want to playThe leadEverybodyJust wants to fall into loveEverybodyEverybodyjust wants to playthe leadEverybody just wants to get into the world and be in the worldAnd we look at them11 waysYouSaid look at us11 waysyou saidLook at me, I looked away,You wrote this songI want playI’ll write you harmonica in C"I think it's about a guy who is trying to get out of a relationship with this girl, but he can't because he's afraid of being hurt by her. "I”m with stupidMoney is a sick muse"He's trying to convince himself that he’s not going to hurt her, and that he is not. "She said I'm with stupid Money is a Sick muse"She's saying that he's with stupid money, and he wants to fuck her because she is the one he better lead. "You said I’m with dumbMoney is the sick muse." I think this is a reference to the fact that he has to deal with all the problems in his life and he can’t do it anymore, so he wants her to help him out. He wants to do it all over again. "And we looks at them Eleven waysYou say look at himI look away, You wrote the musicI want you harmonyIn C"This is the first time I've ever heard this song, and I love it.
Ground Truth: To me, this song is about people falling in love. 'Sick Muse' could be similar to 'love sick', cupid stuck me with a sickness, etc. As well, the song says everybody wants to fall in love, everybody play the lead, this could relate to the classic Romeo/Juliet style relationship. 'i'll write you harmony in C' is writing a love song/poem'you said look at me and looked away' is your standard 'playing hard to get' moveHunterIrkedon October 03, 2009   
Lyrics: I find the map and draw a straight line; Over rivers, farms and state lines; The distance from A to where you'd B; It's only finger lengths that I see; ; I touch the place; Where I'd find your face; My fingers increases; Of distant dark places; ; I hang my coat up in the first bar; There is no peace that I've found so far; The laughter penetrates my silence; As drunken men find flaws in science; ; Their words mostly noises; Ghosts with just voices; Your words in my memory; Are like music to me; ; And miles from where you are; I lay down on the cold ground and I; I pray that something picks me up; And sets me down in your warm arms; ; After I have traveled so far; We'd set the fire to the third bar; We'd share each other like an island; Until exhausted close our eyelids; ; And dreaming pick up from; The last place we left off; Your soft skin is weeping; A joy you can't keep in; ; And miles from where you are; I lay down on the cold ground and I; I pray that something picks me up; And sets me down in your warm arms; ; And miles from where you are; I lay down on the cold ground and I; I pray that something picks me up; And sets me down in your warm arms
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a relationship that has ended. The lines "I find the map and draw a straight lineOver rivers, farms and state linesThe distance from A to where you'd BIt's only finger lengths that I seeI touch the placeWhere I'd find your faceMy fingers increasesOf distant dark placesI hang my coat up in the first barThere is no peace that I've found so farThe laughter penetrates my silenceAs drunken men find flaws in scienceTheir words mostly noisesGhosts with just voicesYour words in my memoryAre like music to meAnd miles from where you areI lay down on the cold groundAnd II pray that something picks me upAnd sets me down in your warm armsAfter I have traveled so farWe'd set the fire to the third barWe'd share each other like an islandUntil exhausted close our eyelidsAnd dreaming pick up fromThe last place we left offYour soft skin is weepingA joy you can't keep inAnd miles away from where they areI lie down on cold ground and I I pray thatSomething pick me upand sets me up in their warm arms"I think it's about a love that has fallen apart, and that is the reason why they're together. I think this is about the relationship that ended, and how they both want to be together again, but they can't because they're so far away from each other. "And dreamingPick up from the last placeWe left off"This is referring to the fact that they are still together, but now that they're gone, they're not together anymore. It's also about how they're still missing each other, and they're both longing for each other and wishing they could be back together again. The line "Your softskin is weeping" is talking about the love they shared, but it's not the same anymore. They're still together. "You soft skin, weeping, a joy you cant keep in"I love this song, and I can't wait to hear it again.
Ground Truth: I can relate, definitely. This song made me think of a guy who lives too far away for anything to work. To me, its about the pain of loving someone who you can never see, and trying to replace them with others, hence the bar references, but not being able to, because you know you'll never feel the same again. Wishing you was with them, or they were with you so much that it hurts :/So I guess it is appropriate for Dear John:)pureimaginationon February 22, 2010   
Lyrics: I need an easy friend; I do with an ear to lend; I do think you fit this shoe; I do but you have a clue; ; I'll take advantage while; You hang me out to dry; But I can't see you every night; Free; I do; ; I'm standing in your line; I do hope you have the time; I do pick a number two; I do keep a date with you; ; I'll take advantage while; You hang me out to dry; But I can't see you every night; Free; I do; ; I need an easy friend; I do with an ear to lend; I do think you fit this shoe; I do but you have a clue; ; I'll take advantage while; You hang me out to dry; But I can't see you every night; No I can't see you every night; Free; I do; I do; I do; I do
Sample outputs: I think this song is about a guy who is in love with a girl but he can't see her because he doesn't know what to do with her. "I need an easy friendI do with an ear to lendI do think you fit this shoeI do but you have a clueI'll take advantage whileYou hang me out to dryBut I cant see you every nightFreeI doI do"I think he's saying that he wants to be with her, but he's not sure if he'll be able to. He doesn't want to be alone with her because she's not there for him. He wants to keep a date with her but he knows she won't let him. I'm standing in your lineI do hope you have the timeI do pick a number twoI do keep adate with you"He's saying he's going to do what he can to get her to take advantage of him, but she can't be with him because she doesn't have the money to do it. He's saying "I do want you to be there for me, but I can't stand you anymore." He's also saying that even if he can see her every night free, he won't be around for her. I do think this is a song about a relationship that he's been in for a long time, and he's trying to convince himself that it's worth it. I think it's about a girl who he's in a relationship with and he just can't help but feel like he's never going to be around her. He loves her so much and wants her to be happy with him.
Ground Truth: this song was written after a fight him and his grilfriend. so he wrote this song, and the fact she was complaining about not having a song about her but he wrote one about masterbation. He listened to a Beatle song, can't recall at the moment, but he listened to it over and over to get in the mood for writing this song. sodapolison August 28, 2008
